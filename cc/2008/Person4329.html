            <h2>Christopher Gomez&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Chris Gomez is considered by many the second-coming of Steve Jobs. His Vulcan-like intelligence, Covey-like wisdom and Toffler-like insight make up the ultimate package every little executive boy &amp; executive girl wish they'd get for Christmas. He is, for lack of a better word, phenomenal.<br>
<br>
Lee Iaccoca would hire Chris for his marketing genius.<br>
<br>
Sir Richard Branson would hire Chris to run his (future) social &amp; environmental enriching projects company called &quot;Virgin Infinity&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ted Turner would hire Chris for his ability to fix under performing P&amp;Ls.<br>
<br>
Stan Shih would hire Chris to help redesign the future of Acer and its product line.<br>
<br>
Christopher Nolan would hire Chris to be part of his SFX design team for The Dark Knight.<br>
<br>
And 'The Artist Formerly Known As Prince' would hire Chris to help him change his name to something more sophisticated sounding like 'My Name Is Earl'.<br>
<br>
Of course he wrote all the above in the the voice of the third person, just so he'd sound dignified... like all the other (self-written) profiles here.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>
<br>
I'm always open to discussing leadership roles in organizations that value the creation of exciting products/services, integrity and the entrepreneurial spirit. I've been blessed thus far with the experience of working in various organizations with fast-paced environments, and the opportunity to lead dynamic teams.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I'm actively involved in industry building - I lecture at universities (on the subjects of participatory media, blogging, internet media policy, and documentary/short film development), and am invited by government &amp; industry organizations to share ideas on new media policy development.<br>
<br>
If you seek a confident leader who's a go-getter, and enjoys nurturing &amp; encouraging innovative ideas within a team for your operations, please feel free to contact me. I'm also available for speaking engagements should you need me to cover topics related to emergent media, industry scenarios, etc.

    <p class="description">Together with Prof. Dr. Faridah Ibrahim (Dean of School of Communication) from the National University of Malaysia, formed the committee to kick off projects with the Ministry of Information (Government of Malaysia), to nurture the development of interaction-based Internet content.<br>
<br>
This project initially involved getting all public and private university/colleges to generate content within their own circle of concern and share them over the internet. In the process, I have put together simple milestones to help the project evolve - by proposing that these &quot;communities&quot; also develop their own video podcasts and release them through this same medium.</p>

We're bringing industry and &quot;Master Class&quot; training for 3D digital artists and animators to members of the computer graphics, animation and film making communities. Our target audiences are accomplished professional 3D modelers &amp; animators, final year research/university students, other CG industry specialists and enthusiasts).<br>
<br>
The range of services Exposure Series is positioned to bring to the industry (especially training, education and project consulting) is highly valued for its real-world focus.<br>
<br>
I organized a &quot;beta&quot; of a Steven Stahlberg-branded training workshop during GRAPHITE 2006 (for 20 people). This course sold out in 2 hours after it was announced on-line - in fact I was requested to add an additional 5 seats.</p>

    <p class="description">Technically, I was hired by the Usaha Tegas Group (the owners of ASTRO - Malaysia's premier satellite tv operator) for my technical skills and my interests in applying it in the media field. Was seconded to MBNS to work in production under various producers - producing talkshows, gameshows and light entertainment. Gained experience in research, basic behind-the-camera, casting and show development.<br>
<br>
Under the watchful eyes of Producers from KingWorld USA, I started off as a talent executive on the highly rated local version of Wheel of Fortune. Eventually moved on to work on other successful shows such, as TV Champion (Tokyo Television), MTV Lip Service (MTV Networks), etc. which were produced for ASTRO.</p>

    <p class="description">The Extol Corporation was one of the first end-to-end security integrators in the country. Led by a visionary and a man who taught us about service from the heart. I was part of the security software development team that's fondly remembered for our revolutionary work for &amp; successful contracts with the US Department of Defence (DOD), and the many detection/cleaning patches we released that successfully managed the spread of many polymorphic/stealth/armored viruses far better than the greats, like McAffee and Norton.<br>
<br>
Hired to work under the highly-regarded software development guru, KK Tee, who took me under his wings and showed me the realities of, and UI challenges faced by the computing fraternity, especially when it involved computing security.<br>
<br>
Worked on UI for collaboration infrastructure for conglomerates/banking sector. Worked on UI for the company, for the software that was catered for government related organizations.</p>
