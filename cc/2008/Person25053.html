            <h2>Giovanni Diviacchi&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm originally from a small town outside Chicago called Cicero.  You may have heard it in the national news, it's usually followed by the phrase &quot;mob related&quot; or &quot;racially motivated.&quot; The street I lived on was part of the Adopt a Roadway program. My street was adopted by the Tortellini crime family of Chicago.  It made for an interesting dynamic, in that we lived on the safest, in terms of unreported crime, and cleanest street in Cicero, but on the other hand, they turned my street into a toll road.  It cost me five dollars to go to and from school each day. The house we lived in was designed by Frank Lloyd Rite, spelled R-I-T-E, and it was very unique because it was built in the back of a miniature gold course golf.  The 16th hole ran through our kitchen.<br>
Did you hear that Bill Gates and his wife are going to have a new baby boy?  Yeah, they&#x2019;re going to call him Bill Gates 2.0.<br>
Monty Python came out with a DVD of all their TV shows.  I bought the record, I bought the tape, I bought the CD, I bought the book, how many versions of the Dead Parrot Sketch do I have to buy before you&#x2019;re satisfied John Cleese!!!

    <p class="description">My parents signed me up for a temp service when I was born, and when I went in for my initial interview after college, they asked me how long I was with the company.  I told them 21 years.  So I got a plum position with one of the Big Eight accounting firms (Kansas or Kansas State, I forget which), but I got a little nervous after they began laying people off, because I wasn't really &quot;qualified&quot; for my position.  So my manager called me into his office one day and said, &quot;Giovanni, as you know, we're laying people off, but we feel your contributions to the company are too important to let you go.&quot;  So I accepted his offer for a volunteer position.  I missed the Benefits, but I got to keep my job.</p>

So I tried one of those ads, &#x201c;How to make millions working from your own home.&#x201d;  And I wanted to try something different, so I started my own hospital.  I was doing so well that I started to run out of beds.  But I had to close down when the neighbors complained about the noise.  Like they never heard a siren before.</p>

There was this one maintenance man in college who would answer every greeting with, &#x201c;OK&#x201d;.  &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going Charlie?&#x201d;  &#x201c;OK&#x201d; &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the weather?&#x201d; &#x201c;OK&#x201d; &#x201c;Doing anything this weekend?&#x201d;  &#x201c;OK&#x201d; So one day, my buddies and I decided to greet him with an OK, before he could, to see what would happen.  So I say, OK, and he froze, and smoke started coming out of his ears, and he passed out, so we rushed him to the hospital, and when he came to, we were at his side, and he said, &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, and he recovered.</p>

We did our best to fit in, but it wasn&#x2019;t working out, so my parents moved out and bought a house using a Reverse Mortgage, which is where you buy the house outright, and the bank sends you a payment each month to buy the house back. The bank though missed some payments, so my parents started foreclosure proceedings, and won. Now they own their own bank.</p>

When he found out it would cost $400 to pay an ambulance to transport him to the hospital, he yelled at me, &#x201c;forget the respirator, I&#x2019;ll hold my breathe, take me.&#x201d; The one thing I learned is that when you buy a burial plot, you get a title to own the land, which was ironic, because my grandfather was a lifetime renter.</dd>

                Authored &quot;How Many Clients Does It Take To Change A Lightbulb: A Lawyer Strikes Back&quot;. Refreshing look at the practice of law from an attorney&#x2019;s perspective, the ones who are usually the butt of jokes. For the law student about to embark on the world of attorney-client relationships, it serves as a training guide by providing an insight into the personalities that clients as humans unavoidably exhibit. A great stocking stuffer or gag gift for the lawyer/law student in the family.  <br>
<br>
Presented at the 10th International Business Rules Forum, &quot;How Many Business Rule Analysts Does It Take to Change a Lightbulb?&quot;. Based on the speaker&#x2019;s experiences launching BRMSs at two government chartered enterprises over seven years, the session took a light-hearted look at the world of business rule implementation.<br>

Presented at the 2008 Telelogic Mid-Atlantic Local User Group meeting: &quot;Documenting rules in DOORS: Not Business Requirements as Usual&quot;
