                Previous work experience consists of both office work and site work. I have worked in civil engineering and non-civil engineering jobs. Hope to learn more new things either in engineering or other fields. Willing to travel for business or relocate temporarily or permanently for work purposes. Good internet connection at work, at home or both is appreciated.

    <p class="description">Tajukon HQ is located at Taman Serdang Perdana, Seri Kembangan, Selangor near South City Plaza. I am presently employed at the site for the construction of the 391 unit Casa Indah 2 Condominiums at Persiaran Surian, Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya. I walked around the site to record the workers&#x2019; activities. I filled in the Daily Report Book, Labour &amp; Materials Received Book and the Concrete Cube Test Book. I sorted concreting DOs. Other duties varied including waiting for the concrete mixers to arrive, measuring the slump and filling in the cube test labels and forms. I was later not required to do these duties anymore. I also sorted the Tajukon site office filing system for about 2 weeks and calculated the concreting volumes.</p>

Our company house was at Alor Akar, about 20 km from Kuantan Port where our project was being constructed. The project was the construction of a new container berth inclusive of crane rails. I recorded into the Daily Progress Report Form the machinery which were working or idling and the construction activities at the gridline references. I filled in the Attendance Form, concreting book, recorded the number of buckets of concrete delivered by the transit mixers and collected the delivery orders, phoned Ravi to ask for the concreting volumes for the previous day, calculated the workers&#x2019; salaries, did photocopying and counted the reinforcement bars for the precast slabs.
