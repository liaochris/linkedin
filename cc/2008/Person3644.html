Lawsuits are here to stay but JSB of Kaiser once said that &#x201c;the more complex the lies and the larger the suits being sued the larger the lien/lein or often liens/leins that follow but the solution is held as a privilege to the rich. Only that can help us get through the fraudulent behaviour of others and force judges to judge fairly lending weight to truth and reason.&#x201d;</p>

And Carla the chameleon was an interesting character you couldn&#x2019;t tell where she would go and I know I know I hear you &#x201c;Blame the Bogus Borderline&#x201d;  she would run around changing all over the place under false pretences as the weather got colder and calder shouting beware a bankruptcy filed will make you bankrupt and send you below normal credit levels forcing us all into foreclosure.<br>

And that&#x2019;s what its like in America or U.S.A or at least in California agencies are making rules for everything so if you get civil case caught, accused the law abuse that follows can be a total brian drain. So the words of this book heed good warning and help you avoid such a breach in case.

The clever thing to do is read this book and avoid companies that con people with the complaint filed or breach of contract or con you into a management conference continued. This behaviour is criminal but entirely legal. The diagnosis should be proper use of contract law in the appropriate county or county in which it was first filed. We must stop these criminals getting away with it.<br>
<br>
We are all comparatively disabled when faced with this level of dishonesty it makes us all distressed and the elderly and disabled really stand no chance. Its as if a herd of elk drove us down in a grove and no one is hearing what&#x2019;s going on. Its our duty to read more books like this and make changes now to help create more equity for all entities concerned.
