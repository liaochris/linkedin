            <h2>Ed Hale&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Optum Consulting Business, based in New York, is a business consulting and services firm that has one very clear objective: to provide solutions to help people. We supply valuable insight, information, knowledge, and expertise to entrepreneurs and small to mid-sized businesses to take what they have and make it better -- so they make more money. Often times entrepreneurs and start-ups just need simple information to get started or to move to the next level in their industry. We handle projects that range in time from fifteen minutes to several months. We are a hands-on database that can answer any question that someone might need to move up and make more money.<br>
<br>
Optum Consulting Health was a simple side business that started innocently enough offering nutritional supplement consulting to friends and friends of friends due to my being in the health industry for many years. It soon turned into a full time job due to word of mouth. The idea was simple enough: answer people's questions and offer advice on what vitamin and nutritional supplements they should take based on their specific needs, their age, gender, and health concerns. I do this on a per-minute fee basis -- not hourly -- with no minimum, and no appointment or consultation necessary. <br>
<br>
That way, the client receives only the information they want or need, they don't have to spend an initial &quot;consultation fee&quot; of two to three hundred dollars, and they can email or call as often as they need to and only get charged for the amount of time it takes us to answer their questions or concerns. <br>
<br>
Clients are more than happy to use the service and continue to recommend us to their friends and family. A real win-win for all involved, both the company and our clients.<br>

Transcendent Media Group is an entertainment company in New York City that houses a record label, a publishing company, a PR firm, and a television production company. Primary focus is music, publishing, online video content, and television.

Hale&#x2019;s newest projects include the non-profit site TuneInTurnOnHelp.org to funnel attention &amp; money to causes and charities and PeaceWithIran.com, a site that attempts to show a different side to the people of Iran in hopes of preventing US military strikes.</p>

    <p class="description">Ed Hale is a busy man. An internationally known singer/songwriter and recording artist, currently in the rock band Transcendence, who has released six albums over the last fifteen years, either solo or with the group, Hale has been featured, reviewed, and interviewed in newspapers and magazines worldwide and has toured throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. Transcendence has two new albums coming out in 2008: All Your Heroes Become Villains and The Great Mistake. If that weren&#x2019;t enough, the band is recoding a new 24 song double-CD solo set of Hale&#x2019;s entitled L&#x2019;intrigue de Femme for release in &#x2018;09. <br>
Cheekily referred to by the name &#x2018;the Ambassador&#x2019; on occasion, Hale attempts to speak five languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, which he occasionally sings in on his albums which add a multi-cultural approach to creating his band's music. Their albums are available on iTunes, Amazon.com, Virgin music, and other retail stores where music is sold.</p>

    <p class="description">I teach Avatar as a way of giving back because someone was good enough to teach it to me once and it really had a profound impact on my life. I practice using the tools because they work. Avatar is a series of courses / classes that provide a wide variety of helpful tools and techniques for consciousness exploration, self discovery, self empowerment, and self improvement. Well worth the money and time. Absolutely invalualbe tools and information for those looking to learn more about themselves or their past, operate at their peak, and live life to its fullest. And in the end you wind up making the world a better place all around you just by being you. I've been doing it for 12 years now and love it. It's good stuff.</p>

    <p class="description">Residential and commercial real estate investment company. I am madly passionate about real estate and have been since i was a child -- probably due to being carted around in the back seat as a youngster most every weekend &quot;looking at hot properties&quot; with my equally passionate about real estate parental figures. At our peak we owned five properties, residential and commercial. By 2003 I was already reading a lot of SELL NOW advice in the private-subscription-only investor groups I was a member of. I heeded the advice and by late 2004 I sold all real estate and put it into precious metals, primarily GOLD. A great decision needless to say. I still love real estate and would love to converse with others about potential hot-spots out there....</p>

    <p class="description">A fiercely ambitious entrepreneur and businessman who at times comes across as passionate about business and innovation as he does his art. He has founded numerous global multi-million dollar corporations over the last twenty years including The Garden of Eden health food stores, which he sold to the GNC Corporation at the age of twenty-seven, and the international vitamin manufacturing company Ageless Foundation Laboratories which sold to publicly-traded Naturade Inc in 2005. Obsessed with anti-aging science he developed the UltraMax-HGH line of products which can be found in just about every health food store in America today.Ageless Foundation Laboratories was a vitamin manufacturing company that specialized in anti-aging nutritional supplements founded by Ed Hale in 1998 who also acted as the head of product research and development and head of marketing. Their products are in major health food stores in the United States and 14 other countries world-wide.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Hale founded the Sebastians Smoothies Juice Bar chain in 1996 in FL with 2 partners due to their shared passion for juicing fresh fruits and vegetables and concocting healthy and delicious smoothies. Two years yielded much fun and learning but the juice bar business is not a high-profit-margin business model. A lot of waste, high employee turn-over  due to the necessity for low wages, and Smoothie King and Jamba Juice were about to enter into a fierce competition with one another. <br>
So with a touch of sadness and much relief we closed the stores after two years. A good call. Jamba Juice got a truckload of venture capital less than two years later and started becoming the behemoth that it is today. <br>
<br>
I am still asked on occasion by friends and clients about their desire to start a juice bar. My advice is always the same. If you want to run it yourself all day and night and make it a little mom and pop, you might be able to squeeze a living out of it. But you aren't going to get rich.</p>

Two long, gruelling years of hard work, innovative thinking, a dedication to excellent customer service, and absolute conviction that success was the only possible outcome, the stores were sold to the GNC corporation in 1998 for a nice size profit that was able to be funnelled into two new companies, Transcendent Media Group and Ageless Foundation Laboratories. <br>
<br>
Ed Hale has extensive experience in all facets of what it takes to make retail stores work and succeed. Though it isn't easy sometimes, it is almost always fun and can be very profitable.</p>

    <p class="description">At the age of 19 Ed Hale bought a struggling 1-room rehearsal studio from another band that was disbanding and with a $5000 loan turned it into a 3-room 24 hours a day rehearsal and recording studio facility that for a few years was considered THE PLACE TO ROCK in SoFlo, hence the &quot;caveman&quot; logo that dominated their local magazine ads. <br>
<br>
Jeeters was a popular hangout and home to both local and nationally famous touring bands for rehearsal and recording for a number of years. Because Ed's first degree was in audio engineering, he had the chance to engineer and produce many great artists. Hale sold the studio in 1995 to a friend who still keeps it running today.</p>
