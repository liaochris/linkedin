  </p>
    <p class="description">Planetree was founded some 25 years ago in the US.<br>
It teaches hospitals how to focus on human beings, rather than on patients.<br>
<br>
Hippocrates taught his students &quot;the healing power of nature&quot; (&quot;vis medicatrix naturae&quot; in Latin). Planetree brings back this core element of health care into the lives of those who provide health care, and to those who receive it.<br>
<br>
I signed up to become one of Holland's first Planetree Trainers.<br>
<br>
In the US, already 125 health care institutions show the world that it is possible to create an atmosphere in the hospital that is no different from people's homes.<br>
<br>
I am very excited to be able to contribute. Planetree has twelve domains where best practises from 25 years of experience are being taught. Number one on this list is ... attention !<br>
<br>

    <p class="description">With any business development, a new idea starts out with a question. Departing from this question is a project, a collaboration. And sometimes a whole series of  projects, of products and services, originates from the passion that is shaped by asking what is core inside the question. <br>
<br>
You know, in Kirlian style photography the seed that is in front of the camera suddenly rises to the whole plant. That in essence is what happens to the question, which carries the energy of the whole project, of the ultimate answer.<br>
<br>
Attention Architecture is an almost forgotten tradition, originating from the oral traditions of soulfood cuisine. I first found out when i was working with a chef-cook in CRM Strategy. For ten years she had sought after her mission in life; and now more and more people from around the globe, they step forward to help shape this wonderful project that is Cultural Fusion - the answer to the question of &quot;what can i do?&quot; - inspired by the Millennium Campaign.</p>

Februari 2006. When transcripting tape#5, something entered my life. I still don't know what it is. Maybe it is the resonance in her and my life. There is still some unfinished business to take care of, and it is only slowly disappearing from my radar screen.<br>
<br>
May 2007. Ok so here's what happened : something changed inside me. It must be the electrical wiring - neurological pathways or something - i can't imagine what happened but it is &quot;included and transcended&quot;. I am back into the project !</p>

    <p class="description">Ecademy Blackstar is a group of people dedicated to the art of accellerated networking. Leader is one of the most connected people on the planet earth, Thomas Power, chairman of Ecademy. In this group of people are Dr. Ivan Misner, founder of BNI ; and Bill Liao of OpenBC. Ecademy Blackstar is a live R&amp;D environment. The word commitment within this group still has its original meaning ; rather than come to the table to see what is there, commitment within this group of 250+ people is the act of bringing something to the table. The fun of live R&amp;D is that there is truly nobody to ask ; leadership means no one is walking in front of you, there is no one that you can follow. As Thomas has once said to me : &quot;dont count on me, you're on your own!&quot; And paradoxical as this may seem, it helped me better than any other piece of advice possibly could have.</p>

While the journey is on-going, i start to understand that my mission is about creating a new domain called &quot;attention&quot;. I am looking for pioneers to enter this new domain, and stake their land by creating jobs that did not exist before. Next come the educational institutes, creating curriculae for these newly invented jobs. Next come the students, and finally the applicants. <br>
<br>
My personal goal is to need less attention for myself so there will be more attention for others. Ultimately the me / not-me border will then dissolve within me.<br>

My current research is about attention. I believe that attention is life's energy. Just like oxygen and sunshine, it should be available for everyone. I hope that, once Attention is available as a product, people can get it much the same way they can obtain clean water.<br>
<br>
I have started a club at Ecademy to create attention as a product. The members create the product by using dialogue; the product development is totally transparent and all members are fully entitled to use the value any way they want, including selling whatever comes out.<br>

    <p class="description">The Message has to get out that The Individual Is Our Most Valuable Resource and That The Individual Counts - Michael Pokocky (editor)<br>
<br>
ABSTRACT:<br>
I consider attention to be the currency of the 21st century. Like money, attention is the carrier of social energy. But attention has properties that are not found in money. One of the most apparent differences is that money is suited for batch-oriented transactions only - something found exclusively in zero sum games (if i have it, you don't have it). Attention is much a more fluid currency, suitable for playing non-zero games (one plus one makes three). Further evolution as i see it is towards the infinite game, where the aim of the game is to play with the rules (as opposed to playing by the rules). Which properties are within attention is something that science has yet to discover. One scientist recently said in WIE Magazine : we have plenty of evidence - what we need now is a new theory. This article proposes a theory of attention.</p>

    <p class="description">I have a dream that communities become the servant leader of communities. <br>
<br>
I believe there is a place for each one of us. This place i call home, a place you can not earn, a place no one can show you. When at this place, we experience flow. When we're outside this place, our attention can not flow and we need to get rid of the superfluous attention by solving problems; or if we run low on problems, by creating problems first and then continue solving them.<br>
<br>
We need to acknowledge the fact that there is a place for each and every one of us. That being different is natural, because each of our places is at different locations. The state of abundance is the natural state of every human being.<br>
<br>
Servant leaders are women and men who are able to receive the superfluous attention; not to keep, but to forward onto the essence of the community, the very reason why these people are together.<br>
<br>
It is my place to be one of those servant leaders. That's where i feel at home.</p>

    <p class="description">First I won the - ChangeThis - Manifesto contest with 400 votes. A huge thanks to my mentor and friend MICHAEL POKOCKY. The prize was that my Manifesto would be published on http://www.changethis.com  (former Seth Godin venture).<br>
<br>
What happened then, was that the editors found my manuscript to be different from a manifesto. So i was requested to rewrite this artpiece of mine. No way, Jose.<br>
<br>
And so i found http://www.lulu.com and selfpublished my newborn baby.<br>

    <p class="description">CreaBrains was a project group of 8-12 people. Their mission: to find out where creativity is located in the brain, and how to make use of it. Will i be more creative when i heat up the room? Our initial focus was on neuropsychological sciences. We organized three major events, and now decided to call it a day. Our group has evolved into three areas : intrapersonal (neuro+biophysio), interpersonal (social interaction), and suprapersonal (the quantum Field, attention). It has been a wonderful journey.</p>

<br>
Well, yeah. I am a consultant. I ask people stupid questions until they either don't want to see me anymore - which happens a lot - or they start to understand what it is that they want. And then, when they realize that what they asked for is not what they want, they ask me something else : &quot;please stop asking me stupid questions&quot;. Anyway, that's my job.<br>

    <p class="description">My task was to create a framework for testing, accepting and implementing computer programs that were being used on the ICT infrastructure. I ran a series of interviews with the system administrators, user groups and external parties like the Ministry of Justice department. My philosophy is that the people who are doing the work are the ones who know what the problems are and how they are best solved. Time and again, the only thing missing is someone who will listen to them, and who can then add up all individual expertise to a simple story. By that time it is clear that some problems can not be solved immediately because of political, financial or other non-technical reasons. But when i went back one year later, most of the findings had been used for a major update of the Police's infrastructure. All is well that ends well. Thanks Andre &amp; Jan.</p>

    <p class="description">The Child Protection Council with the Ministry of Justice, known as RvdK here in the Netherlands, had ordered their first intranet. When the pilot runs were due, someone figured that it might have impact upon performance. After all, there are 28 locations and not all have broadband. So i was asked to design and execute a benchmark to predict the impact. A tough question when no-one knows how many users there will be, what they will do in terms of workload, and how popular the download area will prove to be. This is what really gets me awake : to challenge the impossible and make it look like a piece of cake. A wonderful exercise, and again i loved connecting all these users, it departments, service organisations and the culmination into one simple spread what-if sheet, that tells them each and every month what to do next and what to expect when they don't.</p>

              <h3>Ronald Wopereis&#8217;s Honors:</h3>
              <p class="honors">
                My two greatest honors are my father and my mother - who i am is a combination of who they were, both genetically and in terms of attention. Within me they live forever.<br>
<br>
My biggest awards are my two children, Jerzy and Jirka.<br>
<br>
I hope one day to find out how honors and awards are related.
