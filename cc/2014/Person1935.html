Robert @ Adhd Records' Summary
</h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class=" description summary">
Hey MTV U want Reality? Step into The B-Rock Dis-Reality Show. Not only will U get 2 C 1 of the best new rappers growing up over the past 4 years, U will get 2 C some corrupt cop&#39;slies, Video tapes,lawsuits,false arrests,court drama. watch me take down this Town 1 bad cop at a time! 6 dramas in 1 show, Trailer &amp; the B-Rockumentry coming soon / up for sale complete with music &amp; a story that U just couldnt make up. He also managed to get into the studio &amp; do a few gigs promoting his second CD Face The Music tune in 2 C ,will B-Rock get to finish recording &quot;Face the Music &quot; or will he Face the Music? <br>
<br>
Shopping around the Dis-Reality Show: The Dis-Reality Show is based on the life of B-Rock, aka Bobby Henriksen, an up-and-coming rapper. B-Rock is not an ordinary rapper. B-Rock is a story-teller who writes incredibly detailed stories. Whether imaginary or real, he has a knack to paint so many pictures with his words, simialr to Eminem in the rap genre, but his songs are so detailed that I would compare him to Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
The Dis-Reality Show, Season 1, focuses on a sixteen year old, who does also suffer from bipolar disorder, which is the title of his first CD. As you watch him create this CD in the studio, you are also watching a sixteen year old kid who is so wise beyond his years that when you look at how heavy the lyrics are, you can&#39;t fathom that a sixteen-year-old could experience life as he does. You feel the pain that he has suffered in his mind beyond the kid that you see. Some of it might be imaginary, but what if it&#39;s not? This also gives one an insight into what is going on in a bipolar teen&#39;s mind. Most people who listen to this CD can definitely relate to it because it transends all geographic and demographic boundries.http://www.brockdamic.com IS THE SITE.<br>

POST #1-REWRITE-.My site is A.D.H.D. Records, mainly internet presence. been on the net for 12 years get 10 million hits a year. I have 100 URLs in this site. All are entertainment. I am now organizing them into a huge portal to kick of my radio station, even 1 percent of 10 million is a lot of listeners. I already have 500 shows premixed of ten different genres. I just have to tag it all with intros and outros. I am presently looking to get my own show on XM. WADHD.COM. <br>
<br>
I&#39;m also building a historic TV station on the web to go along with my historicdvds.com and vintage photocds.com. As for myself, I write music, make videos, and am working on a few movie scripts. I have a 4-part comic to go along with the movie script. I also have a completed sitcom with a theme song, etc.I bring to the table a complete project, or as complete as I can get it. I need to get an agent. I have a few kid&#39;s books that I am finishing up. I have lots of phtography projects and also have created a clothing line called bwaregear.com for, B-Rock, for his new release called Bipolar Disorder (deep lyrics.) I am trying to get a show for him on cable using old footage from when he wrote this CD at age 15 /16 and created about 25 mini episodes. I am trying to get him on a tour and get more film for further episodes of The Dis-reality Show. <br>
<br>
I have a few fashion show intros that I&#39;m working on It&#39;s something new I&#39;ve been developing and lots of other projects. I can go on and on. Right now I&#39;m just pulling everything together, one huge self-owned, all-encompassing entertainment portal encapsulated. I&#39;m looking for partners. I&#39;m a great multitasker. I&#39;ve created just about everything here. The concept for B-Rock, I live in up-state New York. I miss the city. I might move down to complete these projects. Pardon the English. I create content, not perfect paragraphs. It will be corrected one post at a time. With the right people, we can do alot <br>
thanks <br>
ROCKMAN

POST # 2 rewriteMy main goal is to take all I have created &amp; shove it down the world&#39;s throat, through the internet. I&#39;m 48 years old. This is my internet model. I am now looking for a team of people to join my company &amp; take all of my projects to the next level. The task being (1) many sub branches(ADHD Entertainment), (2) fashion,(3) sitcom,(4)comic(book &amp; online version),(5) radio station,(6) Dvd company,(7) gaming community(8),historic internet tv staion,(9) mega portal that i think can be bigger than myspace &amp; facebook put together,oh #(10) &amp; a record company. I forgot all about that even though that&#39;s what this all started as. This is my model.<br>
<br>
Two years ago, there were offers to buy my sites because buyers wanted to know how I got my site to a 60 thousand out of say 120 million website,&amp; me, just being one person. Anyway, now that I have really got a firm plan, I want to put together a group of people with the same drive that I have. Well, I actually don&#39;t know may people who have my drive, but determination and expertise are just as important as drive. For the next year, I will be building and rebuilding all my 50 plus sites and adding more. No one can duplicate what I have created over the years in crafting this model because three quarters of it is my personal content, my creatiions, &amp; all the scripts, songs, books are also mine, as well as girl &amp; boy bands, poetry, comic books, kid&#39;s books, sitcoms, reality shows, radio station, webisodes, movies, music, photos, video, music videos, 2 fashion lines, fashion shows, photography, colognes, perfumes, &amp; countless products that I have created in various stages of creation. Some I haven&#39;t even begun to move on, but what makes these so unique is that they all spawn off of each other. Like a tree, as one branch grows another branches off it. I will knock off one project at a time. How far I go and how quickly I get there just depends on how many players I can get involved. Money is not the answer. .

POST # 3 RE-WRITE 4 the past 20 years, I have created many products and projects. Because I now have many of these projects near completion, I am now reaching out. I did the research for years and went to many trade shows of all the industries that I want to be involved with (I probably know some of you). I have seen million dollar companies go under under because it takes so much to build them and by the time they figure it out, everybody is looking for a job. I figured it out, did lots of research on many companies that had one element I wanted! As for myself, I&#39;ve been patient because I am diverse and I know my model will need to be as diverse. I am sure it would take over a million dollars to create and implement just the structure that I have crafted over the years and that many of you in these various bizs know how many people and how much money it takes for a company just to get off the ground. Well, if you find a partner who believes in you, it costs nothing. If you find two partners, it still costs nothing and if you find 5 or 10 partners it still costs nothing - but now you have a company of people (ADHD Entertainment) in the business and know how to implement the strategy of each market I am looking to break into. As you can see, it&#39;s to much for one person to handle. I&#39;ve taken all of these things from concept to creation-ready. I can only handle so much. So if you are in the recording industry, fasion indiustry, televion indiustry, advertisement industry, or web design/graphical artist web guru, as well as other industry-related trades that would be involved in my various projects, if you read down this far then you know I chose you because of the skill of the talent you have and because you are a New Yorker. Right now, just think of this as part of script I&#39;m writing and that you have been chosen... but who of you will take the script and add to it? We can start ADHD ENTERTAINMENT. lets talk<br>
thanks for listening<br>
ROCKMAN

POST #4 RE-WRITE Okay, any way you spell it, it will take you there. This is the way my brain works. I wear many hats. I have a slew of ideas that rotate in a circle and like any company, the idea has to be passed around from office to office to get completed. Well, my head is that office that plucks any one of those ideas that are floating around in a circle, completes another part, and then throws it back in the mix till its time comes around again to get completed .That&#39;s the 24/7 factor that I operate on. To me, if I let it sit, tacked to my wall on clipboards, drawings, sketches, etc., the next phase falls into place naturally. Bipolar Disorder is my latest. My son, B-Rock took 3 years of work and his is going to be a force in the future music world. B-Rock is Billy Joel and Tupac in one, but the marketing is even better and true to who he is, from CD title to CD concept and future marketing etc. Like all the ideas in that circle, they branch off. B-Rock branches off to a clothing line starting with his unique t-shirts and cologne (bottle, box, name, scent, and ad ready), as well as posters of the cd and same design of the t-shirt. A full-apparel line is to come in 1 to 2 years that I am designing myself (combining some of my older desgns) along with my daughter who has her own line coming out in 2 to 3 years also. Anyway, you combine the music, the clothes, the artist (on tour) and you have a marketing gold mine all layed out and ready to plug in every club, in every state from the get-go, I deliver a full well-thought-out and almost complete project. Three years in my think tank now and it&#39;s time to plug away. P.S. I also have several other groups I am working on..and we just started to work on B-Rocks second CD(Face The Music) and another 30 episodes for his dis-reality show

POST#5 re-write..Okay, yet another project that I started about the time of B-Rock three years ago, and another example of the way my system works. Even though I lived, ate, and breathed B-Rock, this company was still being tossed around from office to office and was being refined. Now I have about three hundred titles that I created, tons of footage on my shelf, and pretty unique ideas, as well as a marketable name. I aand Dave. I also have created 2 sub-companies under it historicmp3s and vintagephotocds, and since I&#39;ve put B-Rock on the shelf for awhile I am able to take this idea and run with it for the next year. This is also attached to the TV station I am creating, as well as WADHD RADIO. So, yet another marketable company with commercials, theme song, etc., that ties in with all else I have created further bolstering my claim that my website will be bigger than My Space and Face Book together, as well as support itself without any advertisers. Again, that is part of my model. The only reason my model stands out and cannot be duplicated is because of me. If time is money, then the time I spent on crafting thesetightly knitted projects is worth millions. I also do my own CD and DVD duplication in-house, having spent the entire summer learning how to use the software for the Microtech and Rimage Duplicators that I pruchased along with the Verity CD packers, etc., to print up B-Rock CDs. I have created another biz for local bands in my area to get their CDs duplicated, as well as for my own duplication needs.

POST #6 ALL NEW REVAMPED APP DESIGN. This was actually the second website I created years ago. This was the site that was going to bring people in and link all entertainment sites together and launch my online greeting card company (talk about that later), but because of an accident I had to leave it alone. But in the past few years, I have updated it and it draws some over 100,000 visitors some months. When I launch my radio station this will be one of the pivotal sites, as well as for B-Rock, who is on the main page now. A few of my sites have been around since 2000 and ADHD Records had been around since 1997, so anything I attach to it automatically gets picked up by the search engines. If I put any effort into doing search engine optimization, etc., I could easily get ten million people a year just with his site. Over the years, the company, Egame, wanted to buy it as did others, but this is one of my launching pads for many reasons besides what it offers. I have many more ideas for it which I will be moving on because it now ties into WADHD RADIO, which is starting up this new year.currently rebuilding it behind the scenes. like all other sites

WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THE NEW CD 2011 FIRST SONG IS AT LINKED IN POST OR YOUTUBE 18 SMOKING TRACKS<br>
THIS KIDS ALL GROWN UP NOW post #7 rewrite.listing this as a company because of his music &amp; the merchandise I have created &amp; also because so much of my life went into raising him. What I got out of it was more than I ever expected. He wrote this CD Bipolar Disorder at the ages of fifteen and sixteen and recored it in two takes.He is a craftman with words. I got him to start writing because he suffers inside and I always used to write. After his last stay in a hospital at fifteen, he wrote and wrote and wrote. still hasn&#39;t stopped. I say demo, because the beats are bland, but this CD is more to showcase his talent as a writer and rapper, besides the fact that he has bipolar disorder. Where others have little lyrics and lots of hype around them, B-Rock is raising the bar on rap. He writes what three quarters of the kids of today feel in such a fresh way with a unique urban style with lots of pop and rock blends. Besides the music aspect of him, I think he could be the poster child for the new generation who suffer from bipolar disorder or ADHD, etc. by bringing it to the forefront. His words tell the tale of a tortured youth that many can identify with. His lyrics and music cross all racial bounderies and the concept of the first CD is like a perfect marketing plan. Along with the tee shirt company I created, all elements blend so well together. It&#39;s who he is, what he lives, every day of his life, while trying to make a better day tomorrow. Mental illness affects all of us . It&#39;s like a cancer, but people are still hiding it. I want to bring it to the front to get these kids help. He could be a spokesperson for bipolar and travel the states on the Bipolar Disorder Tour, killing two birds with one stone. Listen to my podcast of his CD.THANKS

Post #8 rewrite This site was created back in 2003 and is getting 2 million hits a year. It had a different theme at the time of several <br>
modeling style sites rolled into one. After an accident, I had to take it down. It was too time-consuming. I have now revamped as my portfolio which was my intial plan in the first place. There are some very unique aspects of this site, as well as the ROCKMAN ELEMENT, which is, of course, to push my projects. Besides my portfolio, are my fashion show intros. This was intended to benefit models and photographers as a modeling community. I still have the ideas and scripts. I just need the time to bring it back to life. Till then, it will serve as my portfolio. I am adding 50 videos of my photos set to music. They are almost completed. I will also be selling some of my best prints, as well as some other creations I&#39;ve <br>
designed. I also will offer services. This is just another doorway to my portal.

post #9 rewrite In my years, I have created quite a few movies, sitcoms, and reality shows. As a person myself, I am a cross between Seinfeld, Romano, Fraiser, &amp; Alf all rolled into one. The characters I have created have similar traits to mine. As you <br>
can see, I am very diverse, so most of my characters have a bit of me in them. My first sitcom is called &quot;Ain&#39;t Life Grand?&quot; The sitcom is roughly based on my life as a contractor. I have the pilot, as well as a template for the first season episodes. I also have a theme song that would rival the theme song from &quot;Friends&quot;. I have a great cast of characters and have set layout pages of jokes to throw in anywhere. I would like to get this sitcom out NOW. I have two other sitcoms. I am currently working on reality shows. <br>
Right now I have the B-Rock Dis-Reality Show. The concept is to watch this star shine from a fifteen-year-old bipolar boy (online now with 20 mini webisodes,) to a touring act, taping future episodes, etc., growing a following, selling an album (two birds one stone). Another show I have is one my daughter created over the years. It&#39;s called Crocky Mackral. It&#39;s about a father who runs around taping the girls and they tape themselves also. It&#39;s fun kid0stuff and needs some more developing, but I have about ten episodes that I can throw together. These are shows of stufff we actually went to and did. Then there are my movies. I have about eight scripts. One is almost done. It has a great soundtrack and tells the story from the four different characters. This is the concept comic that will be used to sell the movie while it&#39;s being made. This is my most developed movie and I want to push it. I also have specs and treatments for others,1. a love story, 2. a sort of rock fantasy, 3. another mafia plot, 4. a romantic plot called &quot;The Mad Poet,&quot; 5. &quot;Two the Hard Way&quot; (action drama). I&#39;ve got other stuff lurking, but I&#39;ve got too much in my head right now.

POST # 10 rewrite I&#39;ve always been a big fan of comics and always wanted to cretae my own comic. Well I have. It&#39;s a four-part comic that tells the story of my movie and will be created specificly to market the movie. I came on to this idea because no one is going to let an unknown in the major movie studio door, and I have this really great movie script that has so many great elements. So it sat for a while. As I reworked the script, it changed a lot and I came up with a marketing plan to create a comic to sell the movie. It&#39;s a lot cheaper that way. Patience wins again. Now I have a four-part comic that tells the story of a movie that I want to sell with characters I can market and show at the toy fair and comic con with four different characters. I already have a free-lance comic artist who is working on the main characters for me, six down and six to go. Once I get them done, I will get pages done and the first comic done by the end of 2010, while trying to shop around my script at the same time. An average movie takes two to five years to make. In the first two to three years, this comic will build an audience, also adding a web element to it. Viewers can watch it being made from the beginning. I also have some ideas for a web comic, taking it viral, that&#39;s the comic part of this ROCKMAN plot. I will be posting the website within the next few months with some characters and information on the artist, comic, and movie.2011 FINALLY GOT ALL 12 CHARACTERS DONE....WILL BE INTRODUCING THEM SOON ON A NEW WEB SITE at WERE ELSE OF COURSE BUT WWW.ROCKMAN,TV

Post #11 rewrite This is what I want to retire doing. I doubt if my mind will ever stop creating. By the time on thing ends, I have created ten more. This is what I am going to do, not spin records, or play what they want me to. It&#39;s play what I want to and my listening habits have been very diverse as well, which is how my RADIO STATION will be. It will cover a centry of music that I have come to love. Music was the first thing in my life and it set me off on this tangent of creativity in life. So I want to give it back by reviving all the history of music since Edison&#39;s first recordings to the present. I have found that podcasting at first will make it easier for me, so my first 500 shows will be podcasting. They will be posted on every one of my sitesthat get millions of hits already. Being that the radio station is very diverse, I&#39;m sure I will get over ten percent of listeners. If my sites get ten million people a year and I get any percentage of them as listeners, that is going to be a great fan base. Plus all the old-timers I will pull in with my radio show for the earlier part of the century, 1900 to 1950, will add to this fan base. Within a year, I will be set up. Right now I&#39;m slowly tagging the intros and outros and setting up the website better. After a year I will do live shows, as well as music interviews, etc. I will <br>
also try to get an XM station.WITH OVER A 50 THOUSAND SONG PLAY LIST AND MANY GENRES TO CHOOSE FROM OVER A CENTURY OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TO I GET 10 MILLION PEOPLE TO MY SITES ONCE I GET THE SITE UP I WILL TURN THOSE PEOPLE INTO LISTENERS

POST #15 SORT OF WHERE IT ALL STARTED,i love music and to write. never wanted to be the rock star but wanted to write the music of a rockstar,i have a very diverse style, i can wrtie rap rock,country,dance ,metal,etc, when the internet came (1997) around i used it to build up my presence using my music to get me traffic to build my online record company,had an accident put a major glitch in my plan, but still my music did its job, got me over 10 million people to my site,at 1 point i was website # 60,??? out of 120 million sites pretty good for a one man op back then against<br>
million dollar companies,i have had lots of internet success with my songs gave them away just to get the traffic and build it up for this day,now i want to place my songs with certain artist,i have a catalog of about 100 songs mine and my bros,as well as my rising star B-Rock xtra stuff that he can place with other artist,but what i am most proud of is this little song i created when i was 18,before there was Will Smith, before there was P-Diddy, there was ROCKMAN and Dance to the Drummers Beat, yes that one, bought the rights to use it from the artist,and laid down my rap, renamed Dance to the Drummers Beat,(do you remember those days),that song did great all over the net and stayed in the top 20 with Master P and Ice T for over 5 years on MP3,its a great novelty song that i rewrote when my best freind (Bird)and former rapper died,it was a tribute to the days and the great songs back then,this is also the song that i want to remake and do on an awards show as a tribute ,the concept i created is that of a high school renunion bringing all these people together, walking in the door with all there swagger and style,while herman kelly plays and me and ? raps, great dance number also paying tribute to all these great acts mentioned in the song, a great cast of rappers the songs can be heard at my site,a little lame in the begining but it can be worked out http://www.mp3.com.au/Track.asp?id=5163

POST # 17 WEBSITES AND PORTALS,over the past 12 years i have learned from the web,about the web,&amp; its power and how it can be used, as with most of my sites (50sites)(100 urls) they all get millions of hits &amp; i have not put any effort into any of them, most have been around for more than 5 years, all crosslink each other all are enteratinment related these were all made just to do one thing, bring people in, like i said in my other post i have the stats to show my rankings when i made it to 60 thousand for adhd records,as well as the millions of hits on each of my other sitesNOW THAT I AM READY and have several things to sell and radio station to push and artist to promote etc,i have a million dollar marketing site, each site needs to be rebuilt,an otimized to be marketed to its fullest potential,this is the job for one person to take one site at a time a web guru/designer,i have so many i even forgotten all the back end scripts that are just set up siting there, I AM UPDATING THEM AS WE SPEAK,BUT i have many ideas for these revampings,and a few more sites up my sleve,and within a few months to a year these site can pull in over 100 million vistors a year, now thats power,&amp; the ground work has already been laid.this was my strategy,to find all the elements i want,i can attract &amp; do attract vistitors from so many demo/geographically life styles and ages now its time to put it to work,PS over the years in my reasearch i have learned how to use and the functions over 300 different computer &amp; web based scripts &amp; programs,to find the best scripts that work for each one of my sites<br>
just to show how powerfull these site sare going to be here is a fact about my ratings , if you just looked at my ADHD site .&amp; put it in to category of music,I was in the top 500 rankings if you then took away all the other sites, that were not of 1 ARTIST , you would see me ROCKMAN at the number 1 postion.A FACT, i was getting more traffic than majoir artist HOW THEY GOT THERE IS MY SECRET

POST # 20 I CAN GO ON about lots of other projects that are in the circle of projects i have created but these are the ones thats are ready to take life,some of these will take a year some will take more, the faster i get a team on board, the faster i will see results, it takes a team to finish what i started,if you think you make a good fit lets talk,need lots of team players,you can see i can run various projects at the same time , as well as how powerful the internet preseance is and how all my projects revolve around each other ,and all have very marketable ideas etc, though they are diverse i can run them all, and do further planning with team memebers, taking them to the next step,in one year if i can get a team together,we could put ADHD ENTERTAINMENT on the map and flood the entertainment world,news blogs,etc with something new every month with a massive marketing campaign,and once these projects get off the ground we open up to produce more ideas,your ideas, because this will be a company with diversity, in five years this could be the biggest company (started with no money down)

THIS IS PART OF MY SITCOM SYNOPSIS, ..From Archie Bunker in &#x201c;All in the Family&#x201d; to Doug Heffernan in &#x201c;King of Queens,&#x201d; the story of an everyday, hard-working man and his common struggle is usually the foolproof formula for laughs. However, sitcoms such as the aforementioned usually take place in New York City or on Long Island, or in another famous city such as Los Angeles or even Milwaukee. Middle America can relate, but not to the degree that they would if the main characters lived in a small town hamlet like their own&#x2026;with this in mind, ADHD Entertainment is proud to bring you &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t Life Grand!&#x201d;&#x2014;a sitcom written by and about an honest hard-working man in a small, unassuming town in the Hudson Valley of New York. This is a town that could really be any suburban town in North America, whether it is in upstate New York, the Midwest, or the south, and is much more relatable to the average American television viewer than a show that takes place in Queens.<br>
The main character, Rob, is a general contractor in a town like so many others in America: quaint, everybody-knows-everybody&#x2019;s business, mom-and-pop deli US of A. After suffering a devastating car accident, he is returning to business as usual, which includes going down to Bubba&#x2019;s Bagel Store every morning to get the same cup of coffee at the same time, and exchange witticisms with Bubba and his wife Marie to add a bit of excitement to small town life. He then interacts with the other eccentric characters in the show&#x2014;his clients, who are often offbeat and unusual to say the least. He has been hired by a condominium complex to do punch list work, and he rents an office there to organize his primary duties and also to work on his creative endeavors. These stories are based on the actual experiences of the show&#x2019;s creator, and his interactions with his clients highlight the peculiarity and unconventional behavior that often lurks behind the idyllic image of picket-fences, small town bliss..

WADHD RADIO SYNOPSIS PART 1<br>
Continuing in its never-ending effort to provide quality entertainment for a demographically diverse audience, ADHD Entertainment is very proud to present you with WADHD Radio. This radio station would actually be more accurately described as a group of radio stations, as there will be at least ten channels to choose from when WADHD Radio is launched, and this will quickly blossom into more. The channels will be divided up in several different ways. There will be channels merely divided up by the decade closest to one&#x2019;s heart and memories&#x2014;the 1940s through the 1990s. If an entire decade&#x2019;s worth of music is too broad for a listener, there will be separate channels dedicated to specific genres, from rock to rap, from jazz to heavy metal to a Dr. Demento-style station&#x2014;even venturing into the early cylinder recordings of Thomas Edison, which ties into another branch of ADHD Entertainment&#x2019;s web-based megaportal, Historic mp3s. There will also be channels dedicated to specific musical groups and bands. WITH OVER A 50 THOUSAND SONG PLAY LIST AND MANY GENRES TO CHOOSE FROM OVER A CENTURY OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TO... I WILL BE THE NEW KING OF ALL MEDIA HOWARD STEARN WAS JUST A ASS WITH A BIG MOUTH AND A LITTLE (d*&amp;k)..I GET 10 MILLION PEOPLE TO MY SITES ONCE I GET THE SITE UP I WILL TURN THOSE PEOPLE INTO LISTENERS

This incredibly diverse radio station comes already equipped with numerous prepared play lists for hour-long radio shows of every flavor. Even indie music by unsigned, up-and coming artists will have its own station. The station will kick off with pre-recorded shows for listeners to enjoy, and live broadcasts will work their way in as the station grows. One of the DJs will be founder Rob Henriksen. This is a character that is well over thirty years in development, and his unique style will not disappoint. All stations will feature DJ Rockman himself, as his style is as diverse as his character. The family and rap stations will also feature Rockman&#x2019;s son B-Rock, a young, up-and-coming rap sensation with an eloquent style and an unforgettable message. Combined, their extraordinary vision provides a myriad of styles and moods, furthering the mission of ADHD Entertainment to provide great entertainment. Incidentally, one of the most important qualities of WADHD Radio is that it comes pre-packaged with the prevailing, demographically diverse Internet presence that is ADHD Entertainment&#x2014;a large group of websites that has already drawn tens of millions of hits. Rockman has drawn at least 100 million visitors over the last ten years with his many projects, at one point garnering an Alexa rating of sixty thousand out of 120 million sites. Now it&#x2019;s time to hand over the job to his son B-Rock, who has his finger on the pulse of today&#x2019;s youth and is just as diverse as his dad. The company&#x2019;s title is joined by &#x201c;Rockman&#x201d; and &#x201c;B-Rock&#x201d; as commanding keywords that will instantly draw a massive audience to WADHD Radio once it is launched. Rockman hopes to capitalize on this and to eventually gain enough listeners to garner a unique XM satellite station, so that he can, in his own words, &#x201c;die doing what [he} loves: playing and listening to music.&#x201d;

ADHD Entertainment continually strives to bridge the gaps between demographics and provide quality entertainment to people of all ages. To this end, we are very pleased to present to you &#x201c;Little Flower,&#x201d; a beautiful nature video that is appropriate and engaging for both children and adults. The original song is uncomplicated enough for small children to learn to sing along, and relaxing enough to work as a lullaby. There are two different versions of &#x201c;Little Flower&#x201d;&#x2014;one is performed by an adult male vocalist, and the other features a young girl performing. Either version may be used depending on the demographic that one is trying to reach.<br>
The video incorporates gorgeous time-lapse imagery to display the growth stages of flowers, providing an unusual glimpse of nature that is both aesthetically pleasing and educational. Along with the beautiful music, there are the enchanting authentic sounds of nature&#x2014;birds chirping, streams bubbling, and bees buzzing. The images and sounds of nature combined with this wonderful song result in an innovative and useful finished product. &#x201c;Little Flower&#x201d; is three minutes and fifty seconds in length. Along with this outstanding music video is our companion project, &#x201c;Crocky/Mackral,&#x201d; a quirky and fun reality show that features interviews conducted by two young girls, who go by the nicknames &#x201c;Corky&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mackral.&#x201d; This series, featuring Robert Henriksen, Tiffany Henriksen and Victoria Zippo, features the making of &#x201c;Little Flower&#x201d; as well. Each mini-episode is about ten minutes in length. The show is funny and touching, and shows the girls trick-or-treating and having fun at home and on the go. One episode features a book signing at Borders with Dylan and Cole Sprouse, stars of the Disney Channel sitcom &#x201c;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody.&#x201d; Join Crocky, Mackral and Rob as they generously provide a humorous glimpse into their lives.<br>

Hey MTV U want Reality? Step into The B-Rock Dis-Reality Show. Not only will U get 2 C 1 of the best new rappers growing up over the past 4 years, U will get 2 C some corrupt cop&#39;slies, Video tapes,lawsuits,false arrests,court drama. watch me take down this Town 1 bad cop at a time! 6 dramas in 1 show, Trailer &amp; the B-Rockumentry coming soon / up for sale complete with music &amp; a story that U just couldnt make up. He also managed to get into the studio &amp; do a few gigs promoting his second CD Face The Music tune in 2 C ,will B-Rock get to finish recording &quot;Face the Music &quot; or will he Face the Music? <br>
<br>
Shopping around the Dis-Reality Show: The Dis-Reality Show is based on the life of B-Rock, aka Bobby Henriksen, an up-and-coming rapper. B-Rock is not an ordinary rapper. B-Rock is a story-teller who writes incredibly detailed stories. Whether imaginary or real, he has a knack to paint so many pictures with his words, simialr to Eminem in the rap genre, but his songs are so detailed that I would compare him to Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
The Dis-Reality Show, Season 1, focuses on a sixteen year old, who does also suffer from bipolar disorder, which is the title of his first CD. As you watch him create this CD in the studio, you are also watching a sixteen year old kid who is so wise beyond his years that when you look at how heavy the lyrics are, you can&#39;t fathom that a sixteen-year-old could experience life as he does. You feel the pain that he has suffered in his mind beyond the kid that you see. Some of it might be imaginary, but what if it&#39;s not? This also gives one an insight into what is going on in a bipolar teen&#39;s mind. Most people who listen to this CD can definitely relate to it because it transends all geographic and demographic boundries. <br>
We are just starting to work on Season 2, which is the second CD, Face The Music. WE RAN OUT OF SPACE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED EMAIL ME OR TO GE A GLIMPSE VISIT WWW.CORNWALLFORUM.COM

AS STATED IN MY POST above i am looking for a Career change,right now i am doing my full time job and building my Company ADHD ENTERTAINMENT.I would consider taking a job (or Partner) helping you setting up your project, if you read all my post and see all i have created with limited funds, i am capable of setting up shop anywhere, tackling any kind of product or projects, i study your model or company and dupilcate most of what i know, i wear many hats i am not looking to take over anyones job,i am more like a think tank person ,look at what you got, brainstorm create concept around it advertising,videos,website,marketing etc, then you pass it off to the pros,who can impliment it,ive worked with over 300 software titles,I dont like traveling to the city, when i relocated here in 91 i traveled to brooklyn &amp; tribeca for a year.love the city but hate the traffic.for sanity sake right off the bat in by 10 out by 3 ,3 to 4 days a week, but would be on call 24/7 on your projects up here in my tranquility, which is where i create best.I dont need to sit around in an office all day my best ideas come when i have peice of mind, thats why i have so many of them,AND THEY ALL FLOW SEAMLESSLY INTO EACH OTHER, they are all very well planned even down to the font, they work for me because thats who i am, once i find out who you are or your product is,i will spawn ideas that flow seamlessly around it,everything i do is who i am, every project i take on, i make it take on its own life and become what it is,B-Rock is perfect example, from 1 bipolar kid ,3 years later i can build an industry around him,infact i have, i just need to get him to the next level,just like all my other projects, they all need to be brought to the next level, you hire me for your projects, or partner with me on my projetcs,&amp; all my projects come with me,i dont know how many of you know the feeling of being part of something big,but being the creator of something big is a different feeling,thats what i love.

I DON&#39;T NEED NO DEGREE I DO IT NATURALLY! Because i am the Product and producer of the products,for me there has always been to much to learn I never wanted to challange the world, and focus on one thing ,like a musician (Say) and then struggle to get there all your life and become angry and bitter, like most people who dont get where they want to be, even though they may truly deserve it. there&#39;s just not enough postions in this world and to many people to fill them,i have been evertything i have wanted to be and did everything i wanted to do,i may even take a few classes at FIT to add to the 6 others courses i have already taken i mastered my diversity learn what i need to know when i need to know it ,the thrill is the creation i emerse my self in it,DOWN TO THE FONT USED, i can take questions from any professinal in the biz and talk at length about any aspect of any of my projetcs ,which is why i am now here, to move my product &amp; projects i am an ARTIST...
