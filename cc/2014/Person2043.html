<p class=" description">
Our invention guarantees global serializability by preventing multidatabase transactions from being serialized in different ways at the participating local database systems (LDBS). In one embodiment tickets are used to inform the MDBS of the relative serialization order of the subtransactions of each global transactions at each LDBS. A ticket is a (logical) timestamp whose value is stored as a regular data item in each LDBS. Each substransaction of a global transaction is required to issue the take-a-ticket operations which consists of reading the value of the ticket (i.e., read ticket) and incrementing it (i.e., write (ticket+1)) through regular data manipulation operations. Only the subtransactions of global transactions take tickets. When different global transactions issue subtransactions at a local database, each subtransaction will include the take-a-ticket operations. Therefore, the ticket values associated with each global subtransaction at the MDBS reflect the local serialization order at each LDBS. The MDBS in accordance with our invention examines the ticket values to determine the local serialization order at the different LDBS&#39;s and only authorizes the transactions to commit if the serialization order of the global transactions is the same at each LDBS. In another embodiment, the LDBSs employ rigorous schedulers and the prepared-to-commit messages for each subtransaction are used by the MDBS to ensure global serializability.

SoCS: Social Media Enhanced Organizational Sensemaking in Emergency Response
</a>
</h3>
<ul class="specifics">
<li>
September 2011
to
Present
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p class=" &#39;&#39;">
Online social networks and always-connected mobile devices have empowered citizens and organizations to communicate and coordinate effectively in the wake of critical events. Specifically, there have been many examples of using Twitter to provide timely and situational information about emergencies to relief organizations, and to conduct ad-hoc coordination. This NSF sponsored multidisciplinary research involving Computer Scientists and Cognitive Scientists at Wright State University and Ohio State University seeks to understand the full ramifications of using social networks for effective organizational sensemaking in such contexts. <br>
<br>
This project is expected to have a significant impact in the specific context of disaster and emergency response. However, elements of this research are expected to have much wider utility, for example in the domains of e-commerce, and social reform. From a computational perspective, this project introduces the novel paradigm of spatio-temporal-thematic (STT) and people-content-network analysis (PCNA) of social media and traditional media content, implemented as part of Twitris (http://twitris.knoesis.org). Applications of STT and PCNA extend well beyond organized sensemaking. For social scientists, it provides a platform that can be used to assess relative efficacy of various organizational structures and is expected to provide new insights into the types of social network structures (mix of symmetric and asymmetric) that might be better suitable to propagate information in emergent situations. From an educational standpoint, the majority of funds will be used to train the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers drawn from the computational and social sciences. <br>

Keywords: Social Networking, Emergency Response, People-Content-Network Analysis (PCNA), Spatio-Temporal-Thematic Analysis (STT Analysis), Organizational Sensemaking, Collaborative Decision Making.<br>

PREDOSE: PREscription Drug abuse Online-Surveillance and Epidemiology project
</a>
</h3>
<ul class="specifics">
<li>
July 2011
to
Present
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p class=" &#39;&#39;">
NIH funded PREDOSE is an inter-disciplinary collaborative project between the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) and the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) at Wright State University. The overall aim of PREDOSE is to develop automated techniques for web forum data analysis related to the illicit use of pharmaceutical opioids. This research complements traditional epidemiological studies involving interview based data gathering. Many Web 2.0 empowered social platforms, including Web forums and Twitter, provide venues for individuals to freely share their experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. PREDOSE aims to analyze such social data to provide timely and emerging information on the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids. Primary goals include:<br>
<br>
To determine user knowledge, attitudes and behavior related to the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids (namely buprenorphine) as discussed on social platforms<br>
<br>
To determine spatio-temporal trends and patterns in pharmaceutical opioid abuse as discussed on Web-based forums <br>
<br>
The project has already provided unusual and unexpected insights, such as self-treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms with Loperamide.

Twitris+: 360 degree Social Media Analytics platform

</h3>
<ul class="specifics">
<li>

</ul>
<div>
<p class=" &#39;&#39;">
Users are sharing voluminous social data (800M+ active Facebook users, 1B+ tweets/week) through social networking platforms accessible by Web and increasingly via mobile devices. This gives unprecedented opportunity to decision makers-- from corporate analysts to coordinators during emergencies, to answer questions or take actions related to a broad variety of activities and situations: who should they really engage with, how to prioritize posts for actions in the voluminous data stream, what are the needs and who are the resource providers in emergency event, how is corporate brand performing, and does the customer support adequately serve the needs while managing corporate reputation etc. We demonstrate these capabilities using Twitris+ by multi-faceted anlaysis along dimensions of Spatio-Temporal-Thematic (STT), People-Content-Network (PCN), and Subjectivity: Emotion-Sentiment-Intent (ESI). Twitris&#39; diversity and depth of analysis is unprecedented. Twitris v1 [2009] focused on STT, Twitris v2 [2011] focused on PCN, and Twitris v3 [2012- ] initiated ESI, extended other dimensions by extending PAN analysis with expression capability involving use of background knowledge, and will soon add real-time analytics incorporating Kno.e.sis&#39; Twarql framework.<br>
<br>
Twitris leverages an array of techniques and technologies that traditionally fall under big data (or scalable unstructured data analysis), social media analysis (including user generated content analysis), and Semantic Web (including extensive use of RDF), and algorithms that use statistical, linguistics, machine learning, and complex/semantic query processing. <br>

kHealth &#x2013; Knowledge-enabled Healthcare is a platform which integrates data from passive and active sensing (including both machine and human sensors) with background knowledge from domain ontologies, semantic reasoning, and mobile computing environments to help people make decisions to improve health, fitness, and wellbeing. kHealth utilizes technology from Semantic Sensor Web, Semantic Perception, and Intelligence at the Interface to enable advanced healthcare applications. Currently we are developing an app to reduce preventable hospital readmissions of patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, and expect to trail it with patients with the hel of our clinical collaborators at OSU Wexner Medical Center. More research in applications to Asthma, GI, Obesity, COPD and other chronic diseases is ongoing.

We&#x2019;ve made significant progress in applying semantics and Semantic Web technologies in a range of domains. A relatively well-understood approach to reaping semantics&#x2019; benefits begins with formal modeling of a domain&#x2019;s concepts and relationships, typically as an ontology. Then, we extract relevant facts &#x2014; in the form of related entities &#x2014; from the corpus of background knowledge and use them to populate the ontology. Finally, we apply the ontology to extract semantic metadata or to semantically annotate data in unseen or new corpora. Using annotations yields semanticsenhanced experiences for search, browsing, integration, personalization, advertising, analysis, discovery, situational awareness, and so on.This typically works well for domains that involve slowly evolving knowledge concentrated among deeply specialized domain experts and that have definable boundaries. However, this approach has difficulties dealing with dynamic domains involved in social, mobile, and sensor webs. This project looks at how continuous semantics can help us model those domains and analyze the related real-time data typically found on social, mobile, and sensor webs, that exhibit five characteristics. First, they&#x2019;re spontaneous (arising suddenly). Second, they follow a period of rapid evolution, involving real-time or near real-time data, which requires continuous searching and analysis. Third, they involve many distributed participants with fragmented and opinionated information. Fourth, they accommodate diverse viewpoints involving topical or contentious subjects. Finally, they feature context colored by local knowledge as well as perceptions based on different observations and their sociocultural analysis.

Twitter has become a prominent medium to share opinions, observations and suggestions in real-time. Insights from these microposts (&quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot;) has proved to be invaluable for businesses and researchers around the world. However, the microblog data published is increasing in numbers with the popularity and growth of Twitter. This has induced challenges in filtering these microblog data to cater the needs for aggregation and collective analysis for sensemaking. Twarql addresses these challenges by leveraging Semantic Web technologies to enable a flexible query language for filtering microblog posts.

PhylOnt is a collabotation project with University of Georgia. The specific objective of this reserach was to develop and deploy an ontology for a novel ontology-driven semantic problem solving approach in phylogenetic analysis and down- stream use of phylogenetic trees. This is a foundation to allow an integrated platform in phylogenetically based comparative analysis and data integration. PhylOnt is an extensible ontology, that describes the methods employed to estimate trees given a data matrix, models and programs used for phylogenetic analysis and descriptions of phylogenetic trees including branch-length information and support values. It also describes the provenance information for phylogenetics analysis data such as information about publications and studies related to phylogenetic analyses. To illustrate the utility of PhylOnt, I annotated scientific literature and files to support semantic search.

Currently, there are many sensors collecting information about our environment, leading to an overwhelming number of observations that must be analyzed and explained in order to achieve situation awareness. As perceptual beings, we are also constantly inundated with sensory data; yet we are able to make sense out of our environment with relative ease. Semantic Perception is a computational framework, inspired by cognitive models of human perception, to derive actionable intelligence and situational awareness from low-level sensor data. The formalization of this ability utilizes prior knowledge encoded in domain ontologies, and hybrid abductive/deductive reasoning, to translate low-level observations into high-level abstractions. A declarative specification defined in OWL allows prior knowledge available on the Web, and annotated with Semantic Web languages, to be easily integrated into the framework.

Millions of sensors around the globe currently collect avalanches of data about our environment. The rapid development and deployment of sensor technology involves many different types of sensors, both remote and in situ, with such diverse capabilities as range, modality, and maneuverability. It is possible today to utilize networks with multiple sensors to detect and identify objects of interest up close or from a great distance. The lack of integration and communication between these networks, however, often leaves this avalanche of data stovepiped and intensifies the existing problem of too much data and not enough knowledge. With a view to alleviating this glut, we propose that sensor data be annotated with semantic metadata to provide contextual information essential for situational awareness. In particular, Semantic Sensor Web is a framework for managing heterogeneity among sensor descriptions and sensor observation data through semantic modeling and annotation to enable advanced Web-based data integration, query, and inference. This project has helped to initiate a W3C Incubator Group, the Semantic Sensor Network XG, and develop a standard ontology and semantic annotation framework. These tools are achieving broad adoption and application within the sensing community for managing sensor data on the Web.<br>

The geographic location of a Twitter user can be used in many applications such as Personalization and Recommendation systems. This work explores the use of an external knowledge-base (Wikipedia) to predict the location of a Twitter user based on the contents of their tweets and compares this approach to the existing statistical approaches. The key contribution of this work is that it does not require a training data set of geo-tagged tweets as used by the state-of-the-art approaches.

The Linked Open Data (LOD) is a major milestone towards realizing the Semantic Web vision, and can enable applications such as robust Question Answering (QA) systems that can answer queries requiring multiple, disparate information sources. However, realizing these applications requires relationships at both the schema and instance level, but currently the LOD only provides relationships for the latter. To address this limitation, we present a solution for automatically finding schema-level links between two LOD ontologies -- in the sense of ontology alignment. Our solution, called BLOOMS+, extends our previous solution (i.e. BLOOMS) in two significant ways. BLOOMS+ 1) uses a more sophisticated metric to determine which classes between two ontologies to align, and 2) considers contextual information to further support (or reject) an alignment. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our solution using schema-level mappings from LOD ontologies to Proton (an upper level ontology) -- created manually by human experts for a real world application called FactForge. We show that our solution performed well on this task. We also show that our solution significantly outperformed existing ontology alignment solutions (including our previously published work on BLOOMS) on this same task.

The Web of Data currently coming into existence through the Linked Open Data (LOD) effort is a major milestone in realizing the Semantic Web vision. However, the development of applications based on LOD faces difficulties due to the fact that the different LOD datasets are rather loosely connected pieces of information. In particular, links between LOD datasets are almost exclusively on the level of instances, and schema-level information is being ignored. In this paper, we therefore present a system for finding schema-level links between LOD datasets in the sense of ontology alignment. Our system, called BLOOMS, is based on the idea of bootstrapping information already present on the LOD cloud. We also present a comprehensive evaluation which shows that BLOOMS outperforms state-of-the-art ontology alignment systems on LOD datasets. At the same time, BLOOMS is also competitive compared with these other systems on the Ontology Evaluation Alignment Initiative Benchmark datasets.

BLOOMS (Jain et al, ISWC2010) is an ontology alignment system which, in its core, utilizes the Wikipedia category hierarchy for establishing alignments. In this paper, we present a Plug-and-Play extension to BLOOMS, which allows to flexibly replace or complement the use of Wikipedia by other online or offline resources, including domain-specific ontologies or taxonomies. By making use of automated translation services and of Wikipedia in languages other than English, it makes it possible to apply BLOOMS to alignment tasks where the input ontologies are written in different languages.

Often the information present in a spatial knowledge base is represented at a different level of granularity and abstraction than the query constraints. For querying ontology&#xc3;&#xa2;&#xc2;&#x20ac;&#xc2;&#x2122;s containing spatial information, the precise relationships between spatial entities has to be specified in the basic graph pattern of SPARQL query which can result in long and complex queries. We present a novel approach to help users intuitively write SPARQL queries to query spatial data, rather than relying on knowledge of the ontology structure. Our framework re-writes queries, using transformation rules to exploit part-whole relations between geographical entities to address the mismatches between query constraints and knowledge base. Our experiments were performed on completely third party datasets and queries. Evaluations were performed on Geonames dataset using questions from National Geographic Bee serialized into SPARQL and British Administrative Geography Ontology using questions from a popular trivia website. These experiments demonstrate high precision in retrieval of results and ease in writing queries.

Mediation and integration of data are significant challenges because the number of services on the Web, and heterogeneities in their data representation, continue to increase rapidly. To address these challenges we introduce a new measure, mediatability, which is a quantifiable and computable metric for the degree of human involvement in XML schema mediation. We present an efficient algorithm to compute mediatability and an experimental study to analyze how semantic annotations affect the ease of mediating between two schemas. We validate our approach by comparing mediatability scores generated by our system with user-perceived difficulty. We also evaluate the scalability of our system on alarge number of exisiting APIs.

We propose a semantic framework for automatically<br>
identifying events as a step towards developing an adaptive<br>
middleware for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).<br>
Current related research focuses on adapting to events that<br>
violate certain non-functional objectives of the service requestor.<br>
Given the large of number of events that can happen<br>
during the execution of a service, identifying events that<br>
can impact the non-functional objectives of a service request<br>
is a key challenge. To address this problem we propose<br>
an approach that allows service requestors to create<br>
semantically rich service requirement descriptions, called<br>
semantic templates. We propose a formal model for expressing<br>
semantic templates and for measuring the relevance of<br>
an event to both the action being performed and the nonfunctional<br>
objectives. This model is extended to adjust the<br>
relevance of the events based on feedback from the underlying<br>
adaptation framework. We present an algorithm that<br>
utilizes multiple ontologies for identifying relevant events<br>
and present our evaluations that measure the efficiency of<br>
both the event identification and the subsequent adaptation<br>
scheme.

Web application hybrids, popularly known as mashups,<br>
are created by integrating services on the Web using their<br>
APIs. Support for finding an API is currently provided by<br>
generic search engines or domain specific solutions such<br>
as ... Shortcomings of both these solutions in terms of and<br>
reliance on user tags make the task of identifying an API<br>
challenging. Since these APIs are described in HTML documents,<br>
it is essential to look beyond the boundaries of current<br>
approaches to Web service discovery that rely on formal<br>
descriptions. In this work, we present a faceted approach<br>
to searching and ranking Web APIs that takes into<br>
consideration attributes or facets of the APIs as found in<br>
their HTML descriptions. Our method adopts current research<br>
in document classification and faceted search and<br>
introduces the serviut score to rank APIs based on their utilization<br>
and popularity. We evaluate classification, search<br>
accuracy and ranking effectiveness using available APIs<br>
while contrasting our solution with existing ones.

Cloud computing has changed the technology landscape by<br>
ordering flexible and economical computing resources to the<br>
masses. However, vendor lock-in makes the migration of applications and data across clouds an expensive proposition.<br>
The lock-in is especially serious when considering the new<br>
technology trend of combining cloud with mobile devices.<br>
In this paper, we present a domain-specific language (DSL)<br>
that is purposely created for generating hybrid applications<br>
spanning across mobile devices as well as computing clouds.<br>
We propose a model-driven development process that makes<br>
use of a DSL to provide sufficient programming abstractions<br>
over both cloud and mobile features. We describe the underlying domain modeling strategy as well as the details of<br>
our language and the tools supporting our approach.

Enterprises are increasingly using social media forums to engage with their customer online- a phenomenon known as Social Customer Relation Management (Social CRM). In this context, it is important for an enterprise to identify &#xc2;&#x93;influential authors&#xc2;&#x94; and engage with them on a priority basis. We present a study towards finding influential authors on Twitter forums where an implicit network based on user interactions is created and analyzed. Furthermore, author profile features and user interaction features are combined in a decision tree classification model for finding influential authors. A novel objective evaluation criterion is used for evaluating various features and modeling techniques. We compare our methods with other approaches that use either only the formal connections or only the author profile features and show a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over these baselines as well as over using Klout score.

[Extended Abstract] We discuss an approach for predicting microscopic (individual) and macroscopic (collective) user behavioral patterns with respect to specific trending topics on Twitter. Going beyond previous efforts that have analyzed driving factors in whether and when a user will publish topic-relevant tweets, here we seek to predict the strength of content generation which allows more accurate understanding of Twitter users&#xc2;&#x92; behavior and more effective utilization of the online social network for diffusing information. Unlike traditional approaches, we consider multiple dimensions into one regression-based prediction framework covering network structure, user interaction, content characteristics and past activity. Experimental results on three large Twitter datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We find in particular that combining features from multiple aspects (especially past activity information and network features) yields the best performance. Furthermore, we observe that leveraging more past information leads to better prediction performance, although the marginal benefit is diminishing.

This work contributes to the study of retweet behavior on Twitter surrounding real-world events. We analyze over a million tweets pertaining to three events, present general tweet properties in such topical datasets and qualitatively analyze the properties of the retweet behavior surrounding the most tweeted/viral content pieces. Findings include a clear relationship between sparse/dense retweet patterns and the content and type of a tweet itself; suggesting the need to study content properties in link-based diffusion models.

Provenance, from the French word &#39;provenir&#39;, describes the lineage or history of a data entity. Provenance is critical information in the sensors domain to identify a sensor and analyze the observation data over time and geographical space. In this paper, we present a framework to model and query the provenance information associated with the sensor data exposed as part of the Web of Data using the Linked Open Data conventions. This is accomplished by developing an ontology-driven provenance management infrastructure that includes a representation model and query infrastructure. This provenance infrastructure, called Sensor Provenance Management System (PMS), is underpinned by a domain specific provenance ontology called Sensor Provenance (SP) ontology. The SP ontology extends the Provenir upper level provenance ontology to model domain-specific provenance in the sensor domain. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the Sensor PMS for provenance tracking in the Linked Sensor Data.

There has been a drive recently to make sensor data accessible on the Web. However, because of the vast number of sensors collecting data about our environment, finding relevant sensors on the Web is a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we present an approach to discovering sensors through a standard service interface over Linked Data. This is accomplished with a semantic sensor network middleware that includes a sensor registry on Linked Data and a sensor discovery service that extends the OGC Sensor Web Enablement. With this approach, we are able to access and discover sensors that are positioned near named-locations of interest.

Workflow management systems (WFMSs) are finding wide applicability in small and large organizational settings. Advanced transaction models (ATMs) focus on maintaining data consistency and have provided solutions to many problems such as correctness, consistency, and reliability in transaction processing and database management environments. While such concepts have yet to be solved in the domain of workflow systems, database researchers have proposed to use, or attempted to use ATMs to model workflows. In this paper we survey the work done in the area of transactional workflow systems. We then argue that workflow requirements in large-scale enterprise-wide applications involving heterogeneous and distributed environments either differ or exceed the modeling and functionality support provided by ATMs. We propose that an ATM is unlikely to provide the primary basis for modeling of workflow applications, and subsequently workflow management. We discuss a framework for error handling and recovery in the METEOR WFMS that borrows from relevant work in ATMs, distributed systems, software engineering, and organizational sciences. We have also presented various connotations of transactions in real-world organizational processes today. Finally, we point out the need for looking beyond ATMs and using a multi-disciplinary approach for modeling large-scale workflow applications of the future.

A number of government, corporate, and academic organizations are collecting enormous amounts of data provided by environmental sensors. However, this data is too often locked within organizations and underutilized by the greater community. In this paper, we present a framework to make this sensor data openly accessible by publishing it on the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud. This is accomplished by converting raw sensor observations to RDF and linking with other datasets on LOD. With such a framework, organizations can make large amounts of sensor data openly accessible, thus allowing greater opportunity for utilization and analysis.

Web service composition has quickly become a key area of research in the services oriented architecture community. One of the challenges in composition is the existence of heterogeneities across independently created and autonomously managed Web service requesters and Web service providers. Previous work in this area<br>
either involved signi&#xfb01;cant human effort or in cases of the efforts seeking to provide largely automated approaches, overlooked the problem of data heterogeneities, resulting in partial solutions that would not support executable work&#xfb02;ow for real-world problems. In this paper, we present a planning-based approach to solve<br>
both the process heterogeneity and data heterogeneity problems. Our system successfully outputs a BPEL &#xfb01;le which correctly solves a non-trivial real-world problem in the 2006 SWS Challenge.<br>

The advancements in computing have resulted in a boom of cheap, ubiquitous, connected mobile devices as well as seemingly unlimited, utility style, pay as you go computing resources, commonly referred to as Cloud computing. Taking advantage of this computing landscape, however, has been hampered by the many heterogeneities that exist in the mobile space as well as the Cloud space.This research attempts to introduce a disciplined methodology to develop Cloud-mobile hybrid applications by using a Domain Specific Language(DSL) centric approach to generate applications. A Cloud-mobile hybrid is an application that is split between a Cloud based back-end and a mobile device based front-end. We present mobicloud, our prototype system we built based on a DSL that is capable of developing these hybrid applications. This not only reduces the learning curve but also shields the developers from the native complexities of the target platforms. We also present our vision on propelling this research forward by enriching the DSLs with semantics. The high-level vision is outline in the ambitious Cirrocumulus project, the driving principle being write once - run on any device.

Web service composition has quickly become an important area ofresearch in the services oriented architecture community. One of the challengesin composition is the existence of heterogeneities between independentlycreated and autonomously managed Web service requesters and Web serviceproviders. This paper focuses on the problem of composing Web services inthe presence of ordering constraints on their operations imposed by the serviceproviders. We refer to the ordering constraints on an services operations asinteraction protocol We present a novel approach to composition involvingwhat we term as pseudo operations to expressively capture the serviceprovider&#x2019;s interaction protocol. Pseudo operations are used to resolveheterogeneities by constructing a plan of services in a more intelligent andefficient manner. They accomplish this by utilizing descriptive humanknowledge from the service provider and capture this knowledge as part of aplanning problem to create more flexible and expressive Web serviceoperations that may be made available to service requesters. We use acustomer-retailer scenario to show that this method alleviates planningcomplexities and generates more robust Web service compositions. Empiricaltesting was performed using this scenario and compared to existing methods toshow the improvement attributable to our method.

Semantic computing technologies have matured to be applicable to many critical domains, such as life sciences and health care. However, the key to their success is the rich domain knowledge which consists of domain concepts and relationships, whose creation and refinement remains a challenge. In this paper, we develop a technique for enriching domain knowledge, focusing on populating the domain relationships. We determine missing relationships between the domain concepts by validating domain knowledge against real world data sources. We evaluate our approach in the healthcare domain using Electronic Medical Record(EMR) data, and demonstrate that semantic techniques can be used to semi-automate labour intensive tasks without sacrificing fidelity of domain knowledge.

The problem of automatic extraction of sentiment expressions from informal text, as in microblogs such as tweets is a recent area of investigation. Compared to formal text, such as in product reviews or news articles, one of the key challenges lies in the wide diversity and informal nature of sentiment expressions that cannot be trivially enumerated or captured using predefined lexical patterns. In this work, we present an optimization-based approach to automatically extract sentiment expressions for a given target (e.g., movie, or person) from a corpus of unlabeled tweets. Specifically, we make three contributions: (i) we recognize a diverse and richer set of sentiment-bearing expressions in tweets, including formal and slang words/phrases, not limited to pre-specified syntactic patterns; (ii) instead of associating sentiment with an entire tweet, we assess the target-dependent polarity of each sentiment expression. The polarity of sentiment expression is determined by the nature of its target; (iii) we provide a novel formulation of assigning polarity to a sentiment expression as a constrained optimization problem over the tweet corpus. Experiments conducted on two domains, tweets mentioning movie and person entities, show that our approach improves accuracy in comparison with several baseline methods, and that the improvement becomes more prominent with increasing corpus sizes.

Existing studies on predicting election results are under the assumption that all the users should be treated equally. However, recent work[14] shows that social media users from different groups (e.g., &#39;silent majority&#39; vs. &#39;vocal minority&#39;) have significant differences in the generated content and tweeting behavior. The effect of these differences on predicting election results has not been exploited yet. In this paper, we study the spectrum of Twitter users who participate in the on-line discussion of 2012 U.S. Republican Presidential Primaries, and examine the predictive power of different user groups (e.g., highly engaged users vs. lowly engaged users, right-leaning users vs. left-leaning users) against Super Tuesday primaries in 10 states. Specifically, we characterize users across four dimensions, including three dimensions of user participation measured by tweet-based properties (engagement degree, tweet mode, and content type) and one dimension of users&#39; political preference. We study different groups of users in each dimension and compare them on the task of electoral prediction. The insights gained in this study can shed light on improving the social media based prediction from the user sampling perspective and more.<br>

User generated content on Twitter (produced at an enormous rate of 340 million tweets per day) provides a rich source for gleaning people&#39;s emotions, which is necessary for deeper understanding of people&#39;s behaviors and actions. Extant studies on emotion identification lack comprehensive coverage of &#39;emotional situations&#39; because they use relatively small training datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, we have automatically created a large emotion-labeled dataset (of about 2.5 million tweets) by harnessing emotion-related hashtags available in the tweets. We have applied two different machine learning algorithms for emotion identification, to study the effectiveness of various feature combinations as well as the effect of the size of the training data on the emotion identification task. Our experiments demonstrate that a combination of unigrams, bigrams, sentiment/emotion-bearing words, and parts-of-speech information is most effective for gleaning emotions. The highest accuracy (65.57%) is achieved with a training data containing about 2 million tweets.

SA-REST, the W3C member submission, can be used for supporting a wide variety of Plain Old Semantic HTML (POSH) annotation capabilities on any type of Web resource. Kino framework and tools provide support of capabilities to realize SA-REST&#x201f;s promised value. These tools include (a) a browser-plugin to support annotation of a Web resource (including services) with respect to an ontology, domain model or vocabulary, (b) an annotation aware indexing engine and (c) faceted search and selection of the Web resources. At one end of the spectrum, we present KinoE (aka Kino for Enterprise) which uses NCBO formal ontologies and associated services for searching ontologies and mappings, for annotating RESTful services and Web APIs, which are then used to support faceted search. At another end of the spectrum, we present Kino W (aka Kino for the Web), capable of adding SA-REST or Microdata annotations to Web pages, using Schema.org as a model and Linked Open Data (LOD) as a knowledge base. We also present two use cases based on KinoE and the benefits to data and service integration enabled through this annotation approach.

Aims: Many websites provide a medium for individuals to freely share their experiences and knowledge about different drugs. Such user-generated content can be used as a rich data source to study emerging drug use practices and trends. The study aims to examine web-based reports of loperamide use practices among non-medical opioid users. Loperamide, a piperidine derivative, is an opioid agonist approved for the control of diarrhea symptoms. Because of its general inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it is considered to have no abuse potential and is available without a prescription. <br>
<br>
Methods: A website that allows free discussion of illicit drugs and is accessible for public viewing was selected for analysis. Web-forum posts were retrieved using Web Crawlers and retained in an Informal Text Database. All unique user names were anonymized. The database was queried to extract posts with a mention of loperamide and relevant brand/slang terms.Over 1200 posts were identified and entered into NVivo to assist with consistent application of codes related to the reasons, dosage, and effects of loperamide use. <br>
<br>
Results: Since the first post in 2005, there was a substantial rise in discussions related to its use by non-medical opioid users, especially in 2009-2011. Loperamide was primarily discussed as a remedy to alleviate a broad range of opiate withdrawal symptoms, and was sometimes referred to as &#39;poor man&#39;s methadone.&#39; Typical doses frequently ranged from 100 mg to 200 mg per day, much higher than an indicated dose of 16 mg per day. <br>
<br>
Conclusions: This study suggests that loperamide is being used extra-medically by people who are involved with the abuse of opioids to control withdrawal symptoms. There is a growing demand among people who are opioid dependent for drugs to control withdrawal symptoms, and loperamide appears to fit that role. The study also highlights the potential of the Web as a &#39;leading edge&#39; data source in identifying emerging drug use practices.

Aims: Many websites provide a means for individuals to share their experiences and knowledge about different drugs. Such User-Generated Content (UGC) can be a rich data source to study emerging drug use practices and trends. This study examined UGC on extra-medical use of loperamide (e.g., Imodium&#xc2;&#xae; A-D) among illicit opioid users. <br>
<br>
Methods: A website that allows for the free discussion of illicit drugs and is accessible for public viewing was selected for analysis. Web-forum posts were retrieved using Web Crawlers and retained in a local text database. The database was queried to extract posts with a mention of loperamide and relevant brand/slang terms. Over 1,290 posts were identified. A random sample of 258 posts was coded using NVivo to identify intent, dosage, and side-effects of loperamide use. <br>
<br>
Results: There has been an increase in discussions related to loperamide&#39;s use by non-medical opioid users, especially in 2010-2011. Loperamide was primarily discussed as a remedy to alleviate a broad range of opiate withdrawal symptoms, and was sometimes referred to as &#39;poor man&#39;s&#39; methadone. Typical doses ranged 70-100 mg per day, much higher than an indicated daily dose of 16 mg. <br>

Conclusions: This study suggests that loperamide is being used extra-medically to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a growing demand among people who are opioid dependent for drugs to control withdrawal symptoms, and loperamide appears to fit that role.

Web services are the new paradigm for distributed computing. They have much to offer towards interoperability of applications and integration of large scale distributed systems. To make Web services accessible to users, service providers use Web service registries to publish them. Current infrastructure of registries requires replication of all Web service publications in all Universal Business Registries (UBR) which provide text and taxonomy based search capabilities. Large growth in number of Web services as well as the growth in the number of registries would make this replication impractical. In addition, the current Web service discovery mechanism is inefficients. Semantic discovery or matching of services is a promising approach to address this challenge. In this paper, we present a scalable, high performance environment for federated Web service publication and discovery among multiple registries. This work uses an ontology-based approach to organize registries, enabling semantic classification of all Web services based on domains. Each of these registries supports semantic publication of the Web services, which is used during discovery process. We have implemented two algorithms each for semantic publication and one algorithm for semantic discovery of Web services. We believe that the semantic approach suggested in this paper will significantly improve Web services publication and discovery involving a large number of registries. As a part of the METEOR-S project, we have leveraged the peer-to-peer networking as a scalable infrastructure for registries that can support automated and semi-automated Web service publication and discovery.

The Carnot Project at MCC is addressing the problem of logically unifying physically-distributed, enterprise-wide, heterogeneous information. Carnot will provide a user with the means to navigate information efficiently and transparently, to update that information consistently, and to write applications easily for large, heterogeneous, distributed information systems. A prototype has been implemented which provides services for (a) enterprise modeling and model integration to create an enterprise-wide view, (b) semantic expansion of queries on the view to queries on individual resources, and (c) inter-resource consistency management. This paper describes the Carnot approach to transaction processing in environments where heterogeneous, distributed, and autonomous systems are required to coordinate the update of the local information under their control. In this approach, subtransactions are represented as a set of tasks and a set of intertask dependencies that capture the semantics of a particular relaxed transaction model. A scheduler has been implemented which schedules the execution of these tasks in the Carnot environment so that all intertask dependencies are satisfied.

Today, many sensor networks and their applications employ a brute force approach to collecting and analyzing sensor data. Such an approach often wastes valuable energy and computational resources by unnecessarily tasking sensors and generating observations of minimal use. People, on the other hand, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to efficiently perceive their environment. One such mechanism includes the use of background knowledge to determine what aspects of the environment to focus our attention. In this paper, we develop an ontology of perception, IntellegO, that may be used to more efficiently convert observations into perceptions. IntellegO is derived from cognitive theory, encoded in set-theory, and provides a formal semantics of machine perception. We then present an implementation that iteratively and efficiently processes low level, heterogeneous sensor data into knowledge through use of the perception ontology and domain specific background knowledge. Finally, we evaluate IntellegO by collecting and analyzing observations of weather conditions on the Web, and show significant resource savings in the generation and storage of perceptual knowledge.

An abstraction is a representation of an environment derived from sensor observation data. Generating an abstraction requires inferring explanations from an incomplete set of observations (often from the Web) and updating these explanations on the basis of new information. This process must be fast and efficient. The authors&#39; approach overcomes these challenges to systematically derive abstractions from observations. The approach models perception through the integration of an abductive logic framework called Parsimonious Covering Theory with Semantic Web technologies. The authors demonstrate this approach&#39;s utility and scalability through use cases in the healthcare and weather domains.

The primary challenge of machine perception is to define efficient computational methods to derive high-level knowledge from low-level sensor observation data. Emerging solutions are using ontologies for expressive representation of concepts in the domain of sensing and perception, which enable advanced integration and interpretation of heterogeneous sensor data. The computational complexity of OWL, however, seriously limits its applicability and use within resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices. To overcome this issue, we employ OWL to formally define the inference tasks needed for machine perception - explanation and discrimination - and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks, using bit-vector encodings and operations. The applicability of our approach to machine perception is evaluated on a smart-phone mobile device, demonstrating dramatic improvements in both efficiency and scale.

A number of government, corporate, and academic organizations are collecting enormous amounts of data provided by environmental sensors. However, this data is too often locked within organizations and underutilized by the greater community. In this paper, we present a framework to make this sensor data openly accessible by publishing it on the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud. This is accomplished by converting raw sensor observations to RDF and linking with other datasets on LOD. With such a framework, organizations can make large amounts of sensor data openly accessible, thus allowing greater opportunity for utilization and analysis.

Visionaries and scientists from the early days of computing and electronic communication have discussed the proper role of technology to improve human experience. Technology now plays an increasingly important role in facilitating and improving personal and social activities and engagements, decision making, interaction with physical and social worlds, generating insights, and just about anything that a human, as an intelligent being, seeks to do. This article presents a vision of Physical-Cyber-Social (PCS) computing for a holistic treatment of data, information, and knowledge from physical, cyber, and social worlds to integrate, understand, correlate, and provide contextually relevant abstractions to humans.<br>

In recent years, sensors have been increasingly adopted by a diverse array of disciplines, such as meteorology for weather forecasting and wildfire detection, civic planning for traffic management, satellite imaging for earth and space observation, medical sciences for patient care using biometric sensors, and homeland security for radiation and biochemical detection at ports. Sensors are thus distributed across the globe, leading to an avalanche of data about our environment. The rapid development and deployment of sensor technology involves many different types of sensors, both remote and in situ, with diverse capabilities such as range, modality, and maneuverability. Today, it&#39;s possible to use sensor networks to detect and identify a multitude of observations, from simple phenomena to complex events and situations. The lack of integration and communication between these networks, however, often isolates important data streams and intensifies the existing problem of too much data and not enough knowledge. With a view to addressing this problem, we discuss a semantic sensor Web (SSW) in which sensor data is annotated with semantic metadata to increase interoperability as well as provide contextual information essential for situational knowledge. In particular, this involves annotating sensor data with spatial, temporal, and thematic semantic metadata.<br>

Sensor Observation Service (SOS) is a Web service specification defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) group in order to standardize the way sensors and sensor data are discovered and accessed on the Web. This standard goes a long way in providing interoperability between repositories of heterogeneous sensor data and applications that use this data. Many of these applications, however, are ill equipped at handling raw sensor data as provided by SOS and require actionable knowledge of the environment in order to be practically useful. There are two approaches to deal with this obstacle, make the applications smarter or make the data smarter. We propose the latter option and accomplish this by leveraging semantic technologies in order to provide and apply more meaningful representation of sensor data. More specifically, we are modeling the domain of sensors and sensor observations in a suite of ontologies, adding semantic annotations to the sensor data, using the ontology models to reason over sensor observations, and extending an open source SOS implementation with our semantic knowledge base. This semantically enabled SOS, or SemSOS, provides the ability to query high-level knowledge of the environment as well as low-level raw sensor data.

Today, many sensor networks and their applications employ a brute force approach to collecting and analyzing sensor data. Such an approach often wastes valuable energy and computational resources by unnecessarily tasking sensors and generating observations of minimal use. People, on the other hand, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to efficiently perceive their environment. One such mechanism includes the use of background knowledge to determine what aspects of the environment to focus our attention. In this paper, we develop an ontology of perception, IntellegO, that may be used to more efficiently convert observations into perceptions. IntellegO is derived from cognitive theory, encoded in set-theory, and provides a formal semantics of machine perception. We then present an implementation that iteratively and efficiently processes low level, heterogeneous sensor data into knowledge through use of the perception ontology and domain specific background knowledge. Finally, we evaluate IntellegO by collecting and analyzing observations of weather conditions on the Web, and show significant resource savings in the generation and storage of perceptual knowledge.

Trust relationships occur naturally in many diverse contexts such as collaborative systems, e-commerce, interpersonal interactions, social networks, and semantic sensor web. As agents providing content and services become increasingly removed from the agents that consume them, the issue of robust trust inference and update becomes critical. There is a need to find online substitutes for additional (direct or face-to-face) cues to derive measures of trust, and create efficient and robust systems for managing trust in order to support decision making. Unfortunately, there is neither a universal notion of trust that is applicable to all domains nor a clear explication of its semantics or computation in many situations. We motivate the trust problem, explain the relevant concepts, summarize research in modeling trust and gleaning trustworthiness, and discuss challenges <br>
confronting us. The goal is to provide a comprehensive broad overview of the trust landscape, with the nittygritties of a handful of approaches. We also provide details of the theoretical underpinnings and comparative analysis of Bayesian approaches to binary and multilevel trust, to automatically determine trustworthiness in a variety of reputation systems including those used in sensor networks, e-commerce, and collaborative environments. <br>

In this paper, we present Twitris, a semantic Web application that facilitates browsing for news and information, using social perceptions as the fulcrum. In doing so we address challenges in large scale crawling, processing of real time information, and preserving spatiotemporal-thematic properties central to observations pertaining to realtime events. We extract metadata about events from Twitter and bring related news and Wikipedia articles to the user. In developing Twitris,we have used the DBPedia ontology.

This paper presents our solution for the i2b2 sentiment classification challenge. Our hybrid system consists of machine learning and rule-based classifiers. For the machine learning classifier, we investigate a variety of lexical, syntactic and knowledge-based features, and show how much these features contribute to the performance of the classifier through experiments. For the rule-based classifier, we propose an algorithm to automatically extract effective syntactic and lexical patterns from training examples. The experimental results show that the rule-based classifier outperforms the baseline machine learning classifier using unigram features. By combining the machine learning classifier and the rule-based classifier, the hybrid system gains a better trade-off between precision and recall, and yields the highest micro-averaged F-measure (0.5038), which is better than the mean (0.4875) and median (0.5027) micro-average F-measures among all participating teams.

To handle the exponential growth in bioscience literature, several knowledge-based search systems that facilitate domain-specific search have been proposed. In such systems, knowledge of a domain of interest is embedded as a backbone that guides the search process. But the knowledge used in most such systems 1. exists only for few well known broad domains; 2. is of a basic nature: either purely hierarchical or involves only few relationship types; and 3. is not always kept up-to-date missing insights from recently published results. In this paper we present a framework and implementation of a focused and up-to-date knowledge-based search system, called Scooner, that utilizes domain-specific knowledge extracted from recent bioscience abstracts. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the field to address all three shortcomings mentioned above. Since recent introduction for operational use at Applied Biotechnology Branch of AFRL, some biologists are using Scooner on a regular basis, while it is being made available for use by many more. Initial evaluations point to the promise of the approach in addressing the challenge we set out to address.

Many research studies adopt manually selected patterns for semantic relation extraction. However, manually identifying and discovering patterns is time consuming and it is difficult to discover all potential candidates. Instead, we propose an automatic pattern construction approach to extract verb synonyms and antonyms from English newspapers. Instead of relying on a single pattern, we combine results indicated by multiple patterns to maximize the recall.

The information overload created by social media messages in emergency situations challenges response organizations to find targeted content and users. We aim to select useful messages by detecting the presence of conversation as an indicator of coordinated citizen action. Using simple linguistic indicators associated with conversation analysis in social science, we model the presence of conversation in the communication landscape of Twitter in a large corpus of 1.5M tweets for various disaster and non-disaster events spanning different periods, lengths of time and varied social significance. Within Replies, Retweets and tweets that mention other Twitter users, we found that domain-independent, linguistic cues distinguish likely conversation from non-conversation in this online (mediated) communication. We demonstrate that conversation subsets within Replies, Retweets and tweets that mention other Twitter users potentially contain more information than non-conversation subsets. Information density also increases for tweets that are not Replies, Retweets or mentioning other Twitter users, as long as they reflect conversational properties. From a practical perspective, we have developed a model for trimming the candidate tweet corpus to identify a much smaller subset of data for submission to deeper, domain-dependent semantic analyses for the identification of actionable information nuggets for coordinated emergency response.

Semantic computing technologies have matured to be applicable to many critical domains such as national security, life sciences, and health care. However, the key to their success is the availability of a rich domain knowledge base. The creation and refinement of domain knowledge bases poses difficult challenges. The existing knowledge bases in the health care domain are rich in taxonomic relationships, but they lack non-taxonomic (domain) relationships. In this paper, we describe a semi-automatic technique for enriching existing domain knowledge bases with causal relationships gleaned from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data. We determine missing causal relationships between domain concepts by validating domain knowledge against EMR data sources and leveraging semantic-based techniques to derive plausible relationships that can rectify knowledge gaps. Our evaluation demonstrates that semantic techniques can be employed to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.

Understanding of Electronic Medical Records(EMRs) plays a crucial role in improving healthcare outcomes. However, the unstructured nature of EMRs poses several technical challenges for structured information extraction from clinical notes leading to automatic analysis. Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques developed to process EMRs are effective for variety of tasks, they often fail to preserve the semantics of original information expressed in EMRs, particularly in complex scenarios. This paper illustrates the complexity of the problems involved and deals with conflicts created due to the shortcomings of NLP techniques and demonstrates where domain specific knowledge bases can come to rescue in resolving conflicts that can significantly improve the semantic annotation and structured information extraction. We discuss various insights gained from our study on real world dataset.

Many complex information needs that arise in biomedical disciplines require exploring multiple documents in order to obtain information. While traditional information retrieval techniques that return a single ranked list of documents are quite common for such tasks, they may not always be adequate. The main issue is that ranked lists typically impose a significant burden on users to filter out irrelevant documents. Additionally, users must intuitively reformulate their search query when relevant documents have not been not highly ranked. Furthermore, even after interesting documents have been selected, very few mechanisms exist that enable document- to-document transitions. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of assertions extracted from biomedical text (called semantic predications) to facilitate retrieving relevant documents for complex information needs. Our approach offers an alternative to query reformulation by establishing a framework for transitioning from one document to another. We evaluate this novel knowledge-driven approach using precision and recall metrics on the 2006 TREC Genomics Track.

Trust relationships occur naturally in many diverse contexts such as collaborative systems, e-commerce, interpersonal interactions, social networks, and semantic sensor web. As agents providing content and services become increasingly removed from the agents that consume them, the issue of robust trust inference and update becomes critical. There is a need to find online substitutes for additional (direct or face-to-face) cues to derive measures of trust, and create efficient and robust systems for managing trust in order to support decision making. Unfortunately, there is neither a universal notion of trust that is applicable to all domains nor a clear explication of its semantics or computation in many situations. We motivate the trust problem, explain the relevant concepts, summarize research in modeling trust and gleaning trustworthiness, and discuss challenges <br>
confronting us. The goal is to provide a comprehensive broad overview of the trust landscape, with the nittygritties of a handful of approaches. We also provide details of the theoretical underpinnings and comparative analysis of Bayesian approaches to binary and multilevel trust, to automatically determine trustworthiness in a variety of reputation systems including those used in sensor networks, e-commerce, and collaborative environments. Ultimately, we need to develop expressive trust networks that can be assigned objective semantics.???

Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has gained significant attention in the Semantic Web community recently. Currently it consists of approximately 295 interlinked datasets with over 50 billion triples including 500 million links, and continues to expand in size. This vast source of structured information has the potential to have a significant impact on knowledge-based applications. However, a key impediment to the use of LOD cloud is limited support for data integration tasks over concepts, instances, and properties. Efforts to address this limitation over properties have focused on matching data-type properties across datasets; however, matching of object-type properties has not received similar attention. We present an approach that can automatically match object-type properties across linked datasets, primarily exploiting and bootstrapping from entity co-reference links such as owl:sameAs. Our evaluation, using sample instance sets taken from Freebase, DBpedia, LinkedMDB, and DBLP datasets covering multiple domains shows that our approach matches properties with high precision and recall (on average, F measure gain of 57% - 78%).

Linked Open Data (LOD) has emerged as one of the largest collections of interlinked structured datasets on the Web. Although the adoption of such datasets for applications is increasing, identifying relevant datasets for a specific task or topic is still challenging. As an initial step to make such identification easier, we provide an approach to automatically identify the topic domains of given datasets. Our method utilizes existing knowledge sources, more specifically Freebase, and we present an evaluation which validates the topic domains we can identify with our system. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of identified topic domains for the purpose of finding relevant datasets, thus showing that our approach improves reusability of LOD datasets.

Research on the biology of parasites requires a sophisticated and integrated computational platform to query and analyze large volumes of data, representing both unpublished (internal) and public (external) data sources. Effective analysis of an integrated data resource using knowledge discovery tools would significantly aid biologists in conducting their research, for example, through identifying various intervention targets in parasites and in deciding the future direction of ongoing as well as planned projects. A key challenge in achieving this objective is the heterogeneity between the internal lab data, usually stored as flat files, Excel spreadsheets or custom-built databases, and the external databases. Reconciling the different forms of heterogeneity and effectively integrating data from disparate sources is a nontrivial task for biologists and requires a dedicated informatics infrastructure. Thus, we developed an integrated environment using Semantic Web technologies that may provide biologists the tools for managing and analyzing their data, without the need for acquiring in-depth computer science knowledge.<br>

The amount of glycomics data being generated is rapidly increasing as a result of improvements in analytical and computational methods. Correlation and analysis of this large, distributed data set requires an extensible and flexible representational standard that is also &#39;understood&#39; by a wide range of software applications. An XML-based data representation standard that faithfully captures essential structural details of a glycan moiety along with additional information (such as data provenance) to aid the interpretation and usage of glycan data, will facilitate the exchange of glycomics data across the scientific community. To meet this need, we introduce GLYcan Data Exchange (GLYDE) standard as an XML-based representation format to enable interoperability and exchange of glycomics data. An online tool () for the conversion of other representations to GLYDE format has been developed.<br>

Entrez Gene (EG), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the Gene Ontology (GO) are three complementary knowledge resources that can be used to correlate genomic data with disease information. However, bridging between genotype and phenotype through these resources currently requires manual effort or the development of customized software. In this paper, we argue that integrating EG and GO provides a robust and flexible solution to this problem. We demonstrate how the Resource Description Framework (RDF) developed for the Semantic Web can be used to represent and integrate these resources and enable seamless access to them as a unified resource. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by answering a real-world biomedical query linking a specific molecular function, glycosyltransferase, to the disorder congenital muscular dystrophy.<br>

<cite>An ontology-driven semantic mashup of gene and biological pathway information: application to the domain of nicotine dependence.</cite>

OBJECTIVES:<br>
<br>
This paper illustrates how Semantic Web technologies (especially RDF, OWL, and SPARQL) can support information integration and make it easy to create semantic mashups (semantically integrated resources). In the context of understanding the genetic basis of nicotine dependence, we integrate gene and pathway information and show how three complex biological queries can be answered by the integrated knowledge base.<br>
<br>
METHODS:<br>
<br>
We use an ontology-driven approach to integrate two gene resources (Entrez Gene and HomoloGene) and three pathway resources (KEGG, Reactome and BioCyc), for five organisms, including humans. We created the Entrez Knowledge Model (EKoM), an information model in OWL for the gene resources, and integrated it with the extant BioPAX ontology designed for pathway resources. The integrated schema is populated with data from the pathway resources, publicly available in BioPAX-compatible format, and gene resources for which a population procedure was created. The SPARQL query language is used to formulate queries over the integrated knowledge base to answer the three biological queries.<br>
<br>
RESULTS:<br>
<br>
Simple SPARQL queries could easily identify hub genes, i.e., those genes whose gene products participate in many pathways or interact with many other gene products. The identification of the genes expressed in the brain turned out to be more difficult, due to the lack of a common identification scheme for proteins.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
<br>
Semantic Web technologies provide a valid framework for information integration in the life sciences. Ontology-driven integration represents a flexible, sustainable and extensible solution to the integration of large volumes of information. Additional resources, which enable the creation of mappings between information sources, are required to compensate for heterogeneity across namespaces. <br>

BACKGROUND:<br>
<br>
A critical aspect of the NIH Translational Research roadmap, which seeks to accelerate the delivery of &quot;bench-side&quot; discoveries to patient&#39;s &quot;bedside,&quot; is the management of the provenance metadata that keeps track of the origin and history of data resources as they traverse the path from the bench to the bedside and back. A comprehensive provenance framework is essential for researchers to verify the quality of data, reproduce scientific results published in peer-reviewed literature, validate scientific process, and associate trust value with data and results. Traditional approaches to provenance management have focused on only partial sections of the translational research life cycle and they do not incorporate &quot;domain semantics&quot;, which is essential to support domain-specific querying and analysis by scientists.<br>
<br>
RESULTS:<br>
We identify a common set of challenges in managing provenance information across the pre-publication and post-publication phases of data in the translational research lifecycle. We define the semantic provenance framework (SPF), underpinned by the Provenir upper-level provenance ontology, to address these challenges in the four stages of provenance metadata:(a) Provenance collection - during data generation(b) Provenance representation - to support interoperability, reasoning, and incorporate domain semantics(c) Provenance storage and propagation - to allow efficient storage and seamless propagation of provenance as the data is transferred across applications(d) Provenance query - to support queries with increasing complexity over large data size and also support knowledge discovery applications. We apply the SPF to two exemplar translational research projects, namely the Semantic Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi SPSE) and the Biomedical Knowledge Repository (BKR) project, to demonstrate its effectiveness.<br>

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) format is being used by a large number of scientific applications to store and disseminate their datasets. The provenance information, describing the source or lineage of the datasets, is playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring data quality, computing trust value of the datasets, and ranking query results. Current provenance tracking approaches using the RDF reification vocabulary suffer from a number of known issues, including lack of formal semantics, use of blank nodes, and application-dependent interpretation of reified RDF triples. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called Provenance Context Entity (PaCE) that uses the notion of provenance context to create provenance-aware RDF triples. We also define the formal semantics of PaCE through a simple extension of the existing RDF(S) semantics that ensures compatibility of PaCE with existing Semantic Web tools and implementations. We have implemented the PaCE approach in the Biomedical Knowledge Repository (BKR) project at the US National Library of Medicine. The evaluations demonstrate a minimum of 49% reduction in total number of provenance-specific RDF triples generated using the PaCE approach as compared to RDF reification. In addition, performance for complex queries improves by three orders of magnitude and remains comparable to the RDF reification approach for simpler provenance queries.<br>

Provenance information in eScience is metadata that&#39;s critical to effectively manage the exponentially increasing volumes of scientific data from industrial-scale experiment protocols. Semantic provenance, based on domain-specific provenance ontologies, lets software applications unambiguously interpret data in the correct context. The semantic provenance framework for eScience data comprises expressive provenance information and domain-specific provenance ontologies and applies this information to data management. The authors&#39; &quot;two degrees of separation&quot; approach advocates the creation of high-quality provenance information using specialized services. In contrast to workflow engines generating provenance information as a core functionality, the specialized provenance services are integrated into a scientific workflow on demand. This article describes an implementation of the semantic provenance framework for glycoproteomics.<br>

High throughput glycoproteomics, similar to genomics and proteomics, involves extremely large volumes of distributed, heterogeneous data as a basis for identification and quantification of a structurally diverse collection of biomolecules. The ability to share, compare, query for and most critically correlate datasets using the native biological relationships are some of the challenges being faced by glycobiology researchers. As a solution for these challenges, we are building a semantic structure, using a suite of ontologies, which supports management of data and information at each step of the experimental lifecycle. This framework will enable researchers to leverage the large scale of glycoproteomics data to their benefit.In this paper, we focus on the design of these biological ontology schemas with an emphasis on relationships between biological concepts, on the use of novel approaches to populate these complex ontologies including integrating extremely large datasets ( 500MB) as part of the instance base and on the evaluation of ontologies using OntoQA metrics. The application of these ontologies in providing informatics solutions, for high throughput glycoproteomics experimental domain, is also discussed. We present our experience as a use case of developing two ontologies in one domain, to be part of a set of use cases, which are used in the development of an emergent framework for building and deploying biological ontologies.<br>

The amount of glycomics data being generated is rapidly increasing as a result of improvements in analytical and computational methods. Correlation and analysis of this large, distributed data set requires an extensible and flexible representational standard that is also &#39;understood&#39; by a wide range of software applications. An XML-based data representation standard that faithfully captures essential structural details of a glycan moiety along with additional information (such as data provenance) to aid the interpretation and usage of glycan data, will facilitate the exchange of glycomics data across the scientific community. To meet this need, we introduce GLYcan Data Exchange (GLYDE) standard as an XML-based representation format to enable interoperability and exchange of glycomics data. An online tool for the conversion of other representations to GLYDE format has been developed.<br>

BACKGROUND:<br>
A critical aspect of the NIH Translational Research roadmap, which seeks to accelerate the delivery of &quot;bench-side&quot; discoveries to patient&#39;s &quot;bedside,&quot; is the management of the provenance metadata that keeps track of the origin and history of data resources as they traverse the path from the bench to the bedside and back. A comprehensive provenance framework is essential for researchers to verify the quality of data, reproduce scientific results published in peer-reviewed literature, validate scientific process, and associate trust value with data and results. Traditional approaches to provenance management have focused on only partial sections of the translational research life cycle and they do not incorporate &quot;domain semantics&quot;, which is essential to support domain-specific querying and analysis by scientists.<br>
RESULTS:<br>
We identify a common set of challenges in managing provenance information across the pre-publication and post-publication phases of data in the translational research lifecycle. We define the semantic provenance framework (SPF), underpinned by the Provenir upper-level provenance ontology, to address these challenges in the four stages of provenance metadata:(a) Provenance collection - during data generation(b) Provenance representation - to support interoperability, reasoning, and incorporate domain semantics(c) Provenance storage and propagation - to allow efficient storage and seamless propagation of provenance as the data is transferred across applications(d) Provenance query - to support queries with increasing complexity over large data size and also support knowledge discovery applicationsWe apply the SPF to two exemplar translational research projects, namely the Semantic Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi SPSE) and the Biomedical Knowledge Repository (BKR) project, to demonstrate its effectiveness.<br>

While many ExpertFinder applications succeed in finding experts, their techniques are not always designed to capture the various levels at which expertise can be expressed. Indeed, expertise can be inferred from relationships between topics and subtopics in a taxonomy. The conventional wisdom is that expertise in subtopics is also indicative of expertise in higher level topics as well. The enrichment of Expertise Profiles for finding experts can therefore be facilitated by taking domain hierarchies into account. We present a novel semantics-based model for finding experts, expertise levels and collaboration levels in a peer review context, such as composing a Program Committee (PC) for a conference. The implicit coauthorship network encompassed by bibliographic data enables the possibility of discovering unknown experts within various degrees of separation in the coauthorship graph. Our results show an average of 85% recall in finding experts, when evaluated against three WWW Conference PCs and close to 80 additional comparable experts outside the immediate collaboration network of the PC Chairs.<br>

The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is rapidly becoming the largest interconnected source of structured data on diverse domains.The potential of the LOD cloud is enormous, ranging from solving challenging AI issues such as open domain question answering to automated knowledge discovery. However, due to an inherent distributed nature of LOD and a growing number of ontologies and vocabularies used in LOD datasets, querying over multiple datasets and retrieving LOD data remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to querying linked data by using alignments for processing queries whose constituent data come from heterogeneous sources. We also report on our Alignment based Linked Open Data Querying System (ALOQUS) and present the architecture and associated methods. Using the state of the art alignment system BLOOMS, ALOQUS automatically maps concepts in users&#x2019; SPARQL queries, written in terms of a conceptual upper ontology or domain specific ontology, to different LOD concepts and datasets. It then creates a query plan, sends sub-queries to the different endpoints, crawls for co-referent URIs, merges the results and presents them to the user. We also compare the existing querying systems and demonstrate the added capabilities that the alignment based approach can provide for querying the Linked data.<br>

Statements about RDF statements, or meta triples, provide additional information about individual triples, such as the source, the occurring time or place, or the certainty. Integrating such meta triples into semantic knowledge bases would enable the querying and reasoning mechanisms to be aware of provenance, time, location, or certainty of triples. However, an efficient RDF representation for such meta knowledge of triples remains challenging. The existing standard reification approach allows such meta knowledge of RDF triples to be expressed using RDF by two steps. The first step is representing the triple by a Statement instance which has subject, predicate, and object indicated separately in three different triples. The second step is creating assertions about that instance as if it is a statement. While reification is simple and intuitive, this approach does not have formal semantics and is not commonly used in practice as described in the RDF Primer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Singleton Property for representing statements about statements and provide a formal semantics for it. We explain how this singleton property approach fits well with the existing syntax and formal semantics of RDF, and the syntax of SPARQL query language. We also demonstrate the use of singleton property in the representation and querying of meta knowledge in two examples of Semantic Web knowledge bases: YAGO2 and BKR. Our experiments on the BKR show that the singleton property approach give a decent performance in terms of number of triples, query length and query execution time compared to existing approaches. This approach, which is also simple and intuitive, can be easily adopted for representing and querying statements about statements in other knowledge bases.<br>

The widespread use of social networking websites in recent years has suggested a need for effective methods to understand the new forms of user engagement, the factors impacting them, and the fundamental reasons for such engagements. We perform exploratory analysis on Twitter to understand the dynamics of user engagement by studying what attracts a user to participate in discussions on a topic. We identify various factors which might affect user engagement, ranging from content properties, network topology to user characteristics on the social network, and use them to predict user joining behavior. As opposed to traditional ways of studying them separately, these factors are organized in our framework, People-Content-Network Analysis (PCNA), mainly designed to enable understanding of human social dynamics on the web. We perform experiments on various Twitter user communities formed around topics from diverse domains, with varied social significance, duration and spread. Our findings suggest that capabilities of content, user and network features vary greatly, motivating the incorporation of all the factors in user engagement analysis, and hence, a strong need can be felt to study dynamics of user engagement by using the PCNA framework. Our study also reveals certain correlation between types of event for discussion topics and impact of user engagement factors.

Disaster affected communities are increasingly turning to social media for communication and coordination. This includes reports on needs (demands) and offers (supplies) of resources required during emergency situations. Identifying and matching such requests with potential responders can substantially accelerate emergency relief efforts. Current work of disaster management agencies is labor intensive, and there is substantial interest in automated tools.<br>
<br>
We present machine&#x2013;learning methods to automatically identify and match needs and offers communicated via social media for items and services such as shelter, money, clothing, etc. For instance, a message such as &#x201c;we are coordinating a clothing/food drive for families affected by Hurricane Sandy. If you would like to donate, DM us&#x201d; can be matched with a message such as &#x201c;I got a bunch of clothes I&#x2019;d like to donate to hurricane sandy victims. Anyone know where/how I can do that?&#x201d; Compared to traditional search, our results can significantly improve the matchmaking efforts of disaster response agencies.

Extracting and representing user interests on the Social Web is becoming an essential part of the Web for personalisation and recommendations. Such personalisation is required in order to provide an adaptive Web to users, where content fits their preferences, background and current interests, making the Web more social and relevant. Current techniques analyse user activities on social media systems and collect structured or unstructured sets of entities representing users&#39; interests. These sets of entities, or user profiles of interest, are often missing the semantics of the entities in terms of: (i) popularity and temporal dynamics of the interests on the Social Web and (ii) abstractness of the entities in the real world. State of the art techniques to compute these values are using specific knowledge bases or taxonomies and need to analyse the dynamics of the entities over a period of time. Hence, we propose a real-time, computationally inexpensive, domain independent model for concepts of interest composed of: popularity, temporal dynamics and specificity. We describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for computing specificity leveraging the semantics of Linked Data and evaluate the impact of our model on user profiles of interests.<br>

Phylogenetic analyses can resolve historical relationships among genes, organisms or higher taxa. Understanding such relationships can elucidate a wide range of biological phenomena, including, for example, the importance of gene and genome duplications in the evolution of gene function, the role of adaptation as a driver of diversification, or the evolutionary consequences of biogeographic shifts. Phyloinformaticists are developing data standards, databases and communication protocols (e.g. Application Programming Interfaces, APIs) to extend the accessibility of gene trees, species trees, and the metadata necessary to interpret these trees, thus enabling researchers across the life sciences to reuse phylogenetic knowledge. Specifically, Semantic Web technologies are being developed to make phylogenetic knowledge interpretable by web agents, thereby enabling intelligently automated, high-throughput reuse of results generated by phylogenetic research. This manuscript describes an ontology-driven, semantic problem-solving environment for phylogenetic analyses and introduces artefacts that can promote phyloinformatic efforts to promote accessibility of trees and underlying metadata. PhylOnt is an extensible ontology with concepts describing tree types and tree building methodologies including estimation methods, models and programs. In addition we present the PhylAnt platform for annotating scientific articles and NeXML files with PhylOnt concepts. The novelty of this work is the annotation of NeXML files and phylogenetic related documents with PhylOnt Ontology. This approach advances data reuse in phyloinformatics.

Phylogenetic analyses can resolve historical relationships among genes, organisms or higher taxa. Understanding such relationships can elucidate a wide range of biological phenomena including the role of adaptation as a driver of diversification, the importance of gene and genome duplications in the evolution gene function, or the evolutionary consequences of biogeographic shifts. The variety of methods of analysis and data types typically employed in phylogenetic analyses can pose challenges for semantic reasoning due to significant representational and computational complexity. These challenges could be ameliorated with the development of an ontology designed to capture and organize the variety of concepts used to describe phylogenetic data, methods of analysis and the results of phylogenetic analyses. In this paper, we discuss the development of PhylOnt - an ontology for phylogenetic analyses, which establishes a foundation for semantics-based workflows including meta-analyses of phylogentic data and trees. PhylOnt is an extensible ontology, which describes the methods employed to estimate trees given a data matrix, models and programs used for phylogenetic analysis and descriptions of phylogenetic trees including branch-length information and support values. The relational vocabulary included in PhylOnt will facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data types derived from both structured and unstructured sources. To illustrate the utility of PhylOnt, we annotated scientific literature to support semantic search. The semantic annotations can subsequently support workflows that requiring the exchange and integration of heterogeneous phylogenetic information.<br>

Industry and researchers have identified numerous ways to monetize microblogs for personalization and recommendation. A common challenge across these different works is identification of user interests. Although techniques have been developed to address this challenge, a flexible approach that spans multiple levels of granularity in user interests has not been forthcoming.<br>
<br>
In this work, we focus on exploiting hierarchical semantics of concepts to infer richer user interests expressed as Hierarchical Interest Graph. To create such graphs, we utilize user&#39;s Twitter data to first ground potential user interests to structured background knowledge such as Wikipedia Category Graph. We then use an adaptation of spreading activation theory to assign user interest score (or weights) to each category in the hierarchy. The Hierarchical Interest Graph not only comprises of user&#39;s explicitly mentioned interests determined from Twitter, but also their implicit interest categories inferred from the background knowledge source. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study which shows an average of approximately eight of the top ten weighted categories in the graph being relevant to a given user&#39;s interests.

Twitter, due to its massive growth as a social networking platform has been in focus to analyze its user generated content for personalization and recommendation tasks. A common challenge across these tasks is identifying user interests from tweets. Lately, semantic enrichment of Twitter posts to determine (entity-based) user interests has been an active area of research. The advantages of these approaches include interoperability, information reuse and the availability of knowledge-bases to be exploited. However, exploiting these knowledge bases for identifying user interests still remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on exploiting hierarchical relationships present in knowledge-bases to infer richer user interests expressed as Hierarchical Interest Graph. We argue that the hierarchical semantics of concepts can enhance the existing systems to personalize or recommend items based on varied level of conceptual abstractness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study which shows an average of approximately eight of the top ten weighted hierarchical interests in the graph being relevant to a given user&#39;s interests.

The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has gained significant attention in the<br>
Semantic Web community over the past few years. With rapid expansion in<br>
size and diversity, it consists of over 800 interlinked datasets with over 60 billion<br>
triples. These datasets encapsulate structured data and knowledge spanning over<br>
varied domains such as entertainment, life sciences, publications, geography,<br>
and government. Applications can take advantage of this by using the knowledge<br>
distributed over the interconnected datasets, which is not realistic to find in a single<br>
place elsewhere. However, two of the key obstacles in using the LOD cloud are the<br>
limited support for data integration tasks over concepts, instances, and properties,<br>
and relevant data source selection for querying over multiple datasets. We review,<br>
in brief, some of the important and interesting technical approaches found in<br>
the literature that address these two issues. We observe that the general purpose<br>
alignment techniques developed outside the LOD context fall short in meeting the<br>
heterogeneous data representation of LOD. Therefore, an LOD-specific review of<br>
these techniques (especially for alignment) is important to the community. The<br>
topics covered and discussed in this article fall under two broad categories, namely<br>
alignment techniques for LOD datasets and relevant data source selection in the<br>
context of query processing over LOD datasets.

We study online social group dynamics based on how group members diverge in their online discussions. Previous studies mostly focused on the link structures to characterize social group dynamics, whereas the group behavior of content generation in discussions is not well understood. Particularly, we use Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to measure the divergence of topics in user-generated contents, and how it progresses over time. We study Twitter messages (tweets) in multiple real-world events (natural disasters and social activism) with different times and demographics. We also model structural and user features with guidance from two socio-psychological theories, social cohesion and social identity, to learn their implications on group discussion divergence. Those features show significant correlation with group discussion divergence. By leveraging them we are able to construct a classifier to predict the future increase or decrease in group discussion divergence, which achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 and an F-1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.8. Our approach allows to systematically study collective diverging group behavior independent of group formation design. It can help to prioritize whom to engage with in communities for specific topics of needs during disaster response coordination, and for specific concerns and advocacy in the brand management.<br>

Disaster affected communities are increasingly turning to social media for communication and coordination. This includes reports on needs (demands) and offers (supplies) of resources required during emergency situations. Identifying and matching such requests with potential responders can substantially accelerate emergency relief efforts. Current work of disaster management agencies is labor intensive, and there is substantial interest in automated tools.<br>
<br>
We present machine&#x2013;learning methods to automatically identify and match needs and offers communicated via social media for items and services such as shelter, money, clothing, etc. For instance, a message such as &#x201c;we are coordinating a clothing/food drive for families affected by Hurricane Sandy. If you would like to donate, DM us&#x201d; can be matched with a message such as &#x201c;I got a bunch of clothes I&#x2019;d like to donate to hurricane sandy victims. Anyone know where/how I can do that?&#x201d; Compared to traditional search, our results can significantly improve the matchmaking efforts of disaster response agencies.

We propose an approach for ranking microblog search results. The basic idea is to leverage user engagement for the purpose of ranking: if a microblog post received many retweets/replies, this means users find it important and it should be ranked higher. However, simply applying the raw count of engagement may bias the ranking by favoring posts from celebrity users whose posts generally receive a disproportionate amount of engagement regardless of the contents of posts. To reduce this bias, we propose a variety of time window-based outlier features that transfer the raw engagement count into an importance score, on a per user basis. The evaluation on five real-world datasets confirms that the proposed approach can be used to improve microblog search.

Many machine learning datasets are noisy with a substantial number of mislabeled instances. This noise yields sub-optimal classification performance. In this paper we study a large, low quality annotated dataset, created quickly and cheaply using Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource annotations. We describe computationally cheap feature weighting techniques and a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm that can be used to iteratively and interactively correcting mislabeled instances to significantly improve annotation quality at low cost. Eight different emotion extraction experiments on Twitter data demonstrate that our approach is just as effective as more computationally expensive techniques. Our techniques save a considerable amount of time.

Cloud computing that provides cheap and pay-as-you-go computing resources is rapidly gaining momentum as an alternative to traditional IT Infrastructure. As more and more consumers delegate their tasks to cloud providers, Service Level Agreements(SLA) between consumers and providers emerge as a key aspect. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on Quality of Service (QoS) attributes is necessary to enforce SLAs. Also numerous other factors such as trust (on the cloud provider) come into consideration, particularly for enterprise customers that may outsource its critical data. This complex nature of the cloud landscape warrants a sophisticated means of managing SLAs. This paper proposes a mechanism for managing SLAs in a cloud computing environment using the Web Service Level Agreement (WSLA) framework, developed for SLA monitoring and SLA enforcement in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). We use the third<br>
party support feature of WSLA to delegate monitoring and enforcement tasks to other entities in order to solve the trust issues. We also present a real world use case to validate our proposal.

Since the early 2000&#x2019;s, Internet usage for health information searching has increased significantly. Studying search queries can help us to understand users &#x201c;information need&#x201d; and how do they formulate search queries (&#x201c;expression of information need&#x201d;). Although cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect a large percentage of the population, few studies have investigated how and what users search for CVD. We address this knowledge gap in the community by analyzing a large corpus of 10 million CVD related search queries from MayoClinic.com. Using UMLS MetaMap and UMLS semantic types/concepts, we developed a rule-based approach to categorize the queries into 14 health categories. We analyzed structural properties, types (keyword-based/Wh-questions/Yes-No questions) and linguistic structure of the queries. Our results show that the most searched health categories are &#x2018;Diseases/Conditions&#x2019;, &#x2018;Vital-Sings&#x2019;, &#x2018;Symptoms&#x2019; and &#x2018;Living-with&#x2019;. CVD queries are longer and are predominantly keyword-based. This study extends our knowledge about online health information searching and provides useful insights for Web search engines and health websites.
