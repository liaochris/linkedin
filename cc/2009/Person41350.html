<br>
Indiaust Consultants was formed in Brisbane, Australia during Vic's tenure serving as President of QTSAN and Chairman of the Southbank Institute Student Association.<br>
<br>
Vic's exposure to academic circles all around Australia (including State Ministers of Education, Directors, Pro-Vice Chancellors etc) during this time provided the foundation of an education consulting company that went on to morph into INDOEURO Consultants.<br>
<br>
The name INDIAUST was created from a fusion of the first 4 letters of India &amp; Australia - since it was decided to target the fast growing Indian market, at the very beginning representing Australian educational institutions in India.<br>
<br>
As the portfolio grew to &gt;28 countries, some &gt;700 educational institutions, and &gt;7000 course options, it became clear that INDIAUST should amend its label &amp; name to reflect the concept of INDO-EUROPEAN education, immigration and employment services ... ergo INDOEURO was born.</p>
