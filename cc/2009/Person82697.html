    <p class="description">Over the last three years, I've taught nearly every subject the center offers. In fact, I spent the better part of a year as the entire upper level math department. I support my fellow teachers by teaching their students and locating instructional materials, even if I'm already teaching. I also maintain students' daily workload, and report any problems to the directors. I provide both initial and on-the-job training in teaching and test administering to teachers and directors. When needed, I also test students for initial placement and measuring progress.<br>

While I have participated in NaNoWriMo as an author every year for the past six years, for two years I stepped up as my local chapter's leadership. As an author, I've crossed the 50,000-word mark four times. As a Municipal Liaison, I've grown local participation by word of mouth and encouraging current authors to recruit their own friends. I've encouraged local participants and friends to take on the challenge, and then meet it. I've organized activities for my group throughout November, and supported others in the group who've wanted to host meetings. I also moderated the local forum and LiveJournal community.</p>

As an Instructor, I taught students science through themed, hands-on activities.</p>

    <p class="description">As a volunteer, I started out with the Support team where I learned to craft concise , informative responses to users' requests for help. I was slowly moving my way up through the different groups within team, being trained to become a fully privileged support volunteer, before I no longer had the time to devote to the team. I also volunteered with the Userpics team right after I taught myself how to use Microsoft Image Composer. As a volunteer in the Userpics team,  I created static and animated avatars based on users' descriptions. While with the team, I also taught myself the basics of working with both Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.</p>

    <p class="description">As the departmental administrative assistant, I completed the usual administrative duties. I also prepared meeting rooms for weekly seminars held by the department chair and assisted in pulling together the annual report for the department. I also had the opportunity to assist the department chair and other professors who refereed academic publications. I mainly facilitated correspondence between authors and the editors, but I did have the opportunity to play around with LaTex to help format an accepted article.<br>
<br>
Accomplishments/Achievements<br>
# Assisted professors in their editorial duties for refereed publications<br>
Learned a couple of tricks on LaTex</p>

    <p class="description">I was accepted as a First-Grade Program docent, where I taught classes on dinosaurs, one-room schoolrooms, and life before electricity. Shortly after starting, I discovered a GIrl Scout Badge Book in the museum's library and gained permission to create programs allowing Scouts to earn a few badges at the museum. Although I left before my work was implemented, I later learned that my guides led to programs for both Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.<br>

During my field experience, I had the opportunity to work with younger students in whole-class groups, small groups, and on an individual basis. I worked in a day care setting, a reading classroom, and a science lab, where I was permitted to create and teach a lesson on day and night.<br>
<br>
For my student teaching, I was placed in a third-grade classroom. While there, I taught the highest section of math and regular sections of reading, science, and social studies. I also had the opportunity to develop and teach classes on the different jobs in a theater and music and movement.</p>
