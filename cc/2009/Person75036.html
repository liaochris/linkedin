Lockehaven was designed for both vacationers and business visitors and is ideal for longer stays. For lots more detail, photos and even videos, please visit the Lockehaven website at www.lockehaven.ca. <br>
<br>
Located right on the water in scenic and peaceful Deep Cove at the edge of BC&#x2019;s wilderness in North Vancouver, Lockehaven seems like a remote coastal resort &#x2013; and yet it is only a 25 minute drive from downtown Vancouver. Restaurants, a pub, kayaking and mountain hiking are an easy walk away. The extra-large self-contained one-bedroom suites, expansive outside decks overlooking the water, outside entrances and in-suite kitchenettes offer luxury and privacy. Each suite has an outdoor hot tub - great for relaxing after a hard day of work or play. The in-suite offices have desks, computers, laser printers, wireless Internet and private VOIP phone lines.<br>
<br>
Noulan now just does the marketing. His wife Denise manages the day to day operation of the resort.</p>

This soon evolved into the position of taking about 1/2 to 2/3 of his time over the period as Director of Business Development, in which he led the initiative to develop this application market through directly selling custom chip designs to the large telecom OEMs in Europe, Asia and North America.</p>

Noulan was made President for a year in an attempt to rescue the business. He investigated the viability of the oil and gas and mining properties and worked with the interim receiver, the bank, a new and respectable stock promoter and a US investment dealer to put together a restructuring and obtained financing for it. Unfortunately one of the three old principals would not allow the plan to proceed.</p>
