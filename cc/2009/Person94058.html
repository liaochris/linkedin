<br>
In 1998 returned to Europe to establish Wheatstone Consulting.  Wheatstone&#x2019;s founding vision had two main areas of focus:<br>
<br>
I.	To help organisations get closer to their customers through creative and appropriate use of &#x2018;point of presence&#x2019; technology. <br>
<br>
II.	To help Technology suppliers and manufacturers from outside Europe to enter into the UK and European market, or for companies to gain an International perspective on new strategies.  <br>
<br>
Wheatstone Consulting has helped a range of companies in both areas since its inception. In addition Wheatstone has also focussed on establishing cross-industry relationships and supporting initiatives.  Examples are a board position in the Mobile Data Association (MDA) and the support of open standards initiatives with the launch of the Mobile Management Forum (MMF).</p>

    <p class="description">Austrade seeks to promote the growth of Australian business overseas.  They felt they had insufficient skill, experience and contacts in the mobile and wireless sector to advise Australian companies and hence made an approach for assistance in market research and early strategy planning for Australian companies seeking to &#x91;put a toe in the water&#x92; in the UK. <br>
<br>
To date research has been provided for nine Australian companies in or around the mobile computing market space to allow Austrade to help these customers understand the current market climate and potential competitive position in the UK.  The confidential research papers provided also include next steps in the context of a proposed high-level strategy for market entry for each of these companies.</p>

    <p class="description">Data Synchronisation vendor Synchrologic had been planning to open an office in Europe for some time but had been frustrated in their search for staff. Approached to lead a project to establish and register the UK company, complete market research, early business development, and prepare launch marketing at a major UK exhibition. Using local industry contacts assistance was provided with the recruitment effort and when a local Managing Director was identified and appointed, the stewardship of the business was handed over completely for him to continue with its development. Following successful international expansion, the Synchrologic business was subsequently acquired by Intellisync Corporation, a leading developer and marketer of innovative wireless software solutions for the global mobile communications market.</p>
