    <p class="description">Dying Van Gogh Records is a boutique independent record label with major label distribution, nationally and internationally. The label was established in 2008 by TMG Records owner Ed Hale and Dippy Records owner Roger Houdaille as a combined effort to pool the talent and resources of both labels together to form a bigger machine. The objective being to sniff out brilliant artists of all genres and formats of music who might just not be getting the attention they deserve and to work towards getting their art out to a public that might derive something out it. At Dying Van Gogh, we don't care about what an artist looks like, nor their age, nor how hip or cool they are half as much as if they're music is great, brilliant, special, or unique. DVG has offices in New York city and Miami. Artists currently signed to the label are: Ex Norwegian, Ed Hale, Transcendence, Andy Pratt, Dreaming in Stereo, Jorge Moreno. We are always looking for new talent. Please email.</p>

    <p class="description">What started out as a side business of offering nutritional supplement advice to friends due to being in the health and wellness industry for many years soon turned into a full time job due to word of mouth. The idea was simple enough: answer people's questions and offer advice on what vitamin and nutritional supplements they should take based on their specific needs, age, gender, and health concerns on a per-minute fee basis - not hourly - with no minimum and no appointment or consultation necessary. <br>
<br>
They receive only the information they want or need, they don't have to spend an initial &quot;consultation fee&quot; of two to three hundred dollars. They email or call as often as they need and only get charged for the amount of time it takes me to answer their questions or concerns. If it takes me five minutes to answer someone's question about calcium, or arthritis, or weight loss, or what have you, then I only bill them for five minutes. They get the information they need and can move on.</p>

    <p class="description">Ed Hale is a busy man. An internationally known singer/songwriter and recording artist, currently in the rock band Transcendence, who has released six albums over the last fifteen years, either solo or with the group, Hale has been featured, reviewed, and interviewed in newspapers and magazines worldwide and has toured throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. Transcendence has two new albums coming out in 2008: All Your Heroes Become Villains and The Great Mistake. If that weren&#x2019;t enough, the band is recoding a new 24 song double-CD solo set of Hale&#x2019;s entitled L&#x2019;intrigue de Femme for release in &#x2018;09. <br>
Cheekily referred to by the name &#x2018;the Ambassador&#x2019; on occasion, Hale attempts to speak five languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, which he occasionally sings in on his albums which add a multi-cultural approach to creating his band's music. Their albums are available on iTunes, Amazon.com, Virgin music, and other retail stores where music is sold.</p>

    <p class="description">I teach Avatar as a way of giving back because someone was good enough to teach it to me once and it really had a profound impact on my life. I practice using the tools because they work. Avatar is a series of courses / classes that provide a wide variety of helpful tools and techniques for consciousness exploration, self discovery, self empowerment, and self improvement. Well worth the money and time. Absolutely invalualbe tools and information for those looking to learn more about themselves or their past, operate at their peak, and live life to its fullest. And in the end you wind up making the world a better place all around you just by being you. I've been doing it for 12 years now and love it. It's good stuff.</p>

    <p class="description">Residential and commercial real estate investment company. I am madly passionate about real estate and have been since i was a child -- probably due to being carted around in the back seat as a youngster most every weekend &quot;looking at hot properties&quot; with my equally passionate about real estate parental figures. At our peak we owned five properties, residential and commercial. By 2003 I was already reading a lot of SELL NOW advice in the private-subscription-only investor groups I was a member of. I heeded the advice and by late 2004 I sold all real estate and put it into precious metals, primarily GOLD. A great decision needless to say. I still love real estate and would love to converse with others about potential hot-spots out there....</p>

Obsessed with anti-aging science he developed the UltraMax-HGH line of products which can be found in just about every health food store in America today.Ageless Foundation Laboratories was a vitamin manufacturing company that specialized in anti-aging nutritional supplements founded by Ed Hale in 1998 who also acted as the head of product research and development and head of marketing. Their products are in major health food stores in the United States and 14 other countries world-wide.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Hale founded the Sebastians Smoothies Juice Bar chain in 1996 in FL with 2 partners due to their shared passion for juicing fresh fruits and vegetables and concocting healthy and delicious smoothies. Two years yielded much fun and learning but the juice bar business is not a high-profit-margin business model. A lot of waste, high employee turn-over  due to the necessity for low wages, and Smoothie King and Jamba Juice were about to enter into a fierce competition with one another. <br>
So with a touch of sadness and much relief we closed the stores after two years. A good call. Jamba Juice got a truckload of venture capital less than two years later and started becoming the behemoth that it is today. <br>
<br>
I am still asked on occasion by friends and clients about their desire to start a juice bar. My advice is always the same. If you want to run it yourself all day and night and make it a little mom and pop, you might be able to squeeze a living out of it. But you aren't going to get rich.</p>

Two long, gruelling years of hard work, innovative thinking, a dedication to excellent customer service, and absolute conviction that success was the only possible outcome, the stores were sold to the GNC corporation in 1998 for a nice size profit that was able to be funnelled into two new companies, Transcendent Media Group and Ageless Foundation Laboratories. <br>
<br>
Ed Hale has extensive experience in all facets of what it takes to make retail stores work and succeed. Though it isn't easy sometimes, it is almost always fun and can be very profitable.</p>

    <p class="description">At the age of 19 Ed Hale bought a struggling 1-room rehearsal studio from another band that was disbanding and with a $5000 loan turned it into a 3-room 24 hours a day rehearsal and recording studio facility that for a few years was considered THE PLACE TO ROCK in SoFlo, hence the &quot;caveman&quot; logo that dominated their local magazine ads. <br>
<br>
Jeeters was a popular hangout and home to both local and nationally famous touring bands for rehearsal and recording for a number of years. Because Ed's first degree was in audio engineering, he had the chance to engineer and produce many great artists. Hale sold the studio in 1995 to a friend who still keeps it running today.</p>
