I have been in advice business long enough and advised many people about owning shares via the traditional buy and hold, at any time and at any price method for long enough to know that hindsight and recent movement in share markets can lead to a range of emotions and views that are not always helpful. Also, what appear to be very good gains can evaporate in a very short space of time. Whilst feeling good about being invested in the sharemarket from 2003 through 2007, even gains from the strongest bull market in history can vanish very quickly, as can be seen from the past 2 years.   We have created our Directional Market Decisions (DMD) technology - unique to the financial planning or investment advice world.  It is literally a mathematical method to capture the large portion of market gains whilst avoiding the large portion of market declines. DMD methodology works far better and with much less downside risk than any form of buy and hold investing, in both long term secular bull and secular bear markets. <br>
<br>
Whilst I am convinced we have now entered a secular bear market in the U.S., which will most likely spill over substantially to the European, Asian and Australian share markets, whether this holds true or not (only time will tell whether this is indeed the case as the next few years unfold), investing via the DMD methodology with a facility that allows me to do this for our clients, is a dramatically safer way to invest than anything either of us have seen before, with far better results..<br>

    <p class="description">Whether we like it or not, there is no escaping the fact that money will play a role and indeed have an impact in our lives. We live in a consumer society that tells us yes you need to buy a house, a car, get a mortgage, buy an investment property, have a great superannuation fund, buy some shares, oh and yes, would you like fries with that? It is a dense jungle lurking with potential financial dangers, challenges and pitfalls. <br>
<br>
Naively, the majority of people will attempt to tackle this jungle on their own with very little if any financial education or experience. It is alarming to note that most will not consider getting some guidance or constructing a sound and strategic map to help them get to where they want to go. Just as alarming, they will not employ an experienced and trained guide to help them navigate the pitfalls and dangers and get them to their final destination safe and sound. With that in mind is it any wonder that most people will struggle financially?  It is through constant visioning and setting goals with trusted advice along the way. A long term commitment to planning and reviewing is the primary difference between the financially successful and the rest.<br>
<br>
Moneytree Partners mission is to better the lives of people of all ages by providing sound advice in all spectrums of their aspirations and offering comprehensive expertise to help them improve their financial position and achieve their goals. A Financial Adviser&#x2019;s role is to work closely with you to understand your current financial position, help you get clear about your financial goals and highlight any issues you may be currently facing that may prevent you from achieving those goals.   In essence they will become your financial coach.</p>

    <p class="description">&#x2022;	Master of Business Administration, completed March 2009 (Strategy and Finance concentrations).  The Economist Magazine ranks MGSM MBA 2nd in Austalia and 55th globally. http://www.economist.com/business-education/whichmba/<br>
<br>
With MBA programs costing $50,000 plus taking up 2 years full-time hence serious loss of wages, you want to make sure that an MBA is going to help you get the most bang for your buck after you graduate. <br>
<br>
The most logical use for an MBA is in the business and finance sectors.  Because MBA programs teach students about important business concerns like leadership, money management, HR, and marketing it makes sense that these skills would help advancement in the field of business. In fact, many companies limit their searches for upper level managers to those with MBA degrees, opening up new possibilities for careers to those who have the necessary experience. <br>
<br>
Of course, business isn&#xed;t the only field where an MBA can come in handy. Graduates of MBA programs will learn the management skills they need to work in administrative and leadership positions within these fields, giving them more career mobility and the possibility of advancement beyond what their undergraduate degrees allow. <br>
<br>
There are a variety of MBA programs that provide specialty training in entrepreneurship to help those who have a great business idea finally get the training and expertise, not to mention the business connections, to get it off the ground. With courses in everything from accounting to information technology, graduates of an MBA program should be prepared to handle all the obstacles that come along with starting up businesses. <br>
<br>
Graduates of an MBA program can choose to use their skills to help others in a nonprofit or to climb the corporate ladder and reach the upper echelons of management. Regardless of the career path you choose, your return on a MBA is based on how much you want to push yourself to reach your personal and professional goals.</p>

    <p class="description">&#x2022;	Sourced and negotiated pricing for aboriginal artworks including establishing blanket purchase, put/call options and bulk pricing agreements. <br>
<br>
Investing in Australian Aboriginal Art is not only a financially lucrative pursuit for art investors, but also for insightful amateur collectors. The increasing popularity of Aboriginal Art has reached all parts of Australia, and is still luring more enthusiasts with both professional and personal motives. As it gains more international attention, Aboriginal Art buyers and collectors are becoming increasingly aware of the potentially lucrative future of this investment when they pursue it diligently.<br>
<br>
Today art has replaced blue chip stocks, bonds, shares and other forms of investments that have always been classified in the high returns group. Approximately 70% of Australian Art&#x2019;s total exports are Aboriginal Art, which accounts for almost half the value of the entire Australian Art market. Aboriginal Art is currently the most popular art form in Australia, significantly outselling other types of non-indigenous forms of art. It presently accounts for a little over 60% of displays in art galleries all over Australia. Even famous European museums have recognised the success and worth of Australian Aboriginal Art and decided against overlooking this golden opportunity by investing in this booming art scene that has undoubtedly taken the world by storm.<br>
<br>
While the rest of the world begins to explore and appreciate the rare and unique beauty of Aboriginal Art, prices are dramatically increasing. Now is the ideal time for the astute investor to make a reliable investment which promises a lucrative financial return.  In addition to being a reliable and lucrative investment, Australian Aboriginal Art is the most authentic form of art in the world, beautiful in its many colours and uniqueness and can often be quite intense as it allows the viewer access to the lives and stories of various Indigenous communities.</p>

When it comes to Financial Advice, money can&#x2019;t buy happiness &#x2013; unless you&#x2019;re shopping in the right place. If you are a high net worth individual, which means having investments worth at least $1 million besides the family home, you may have gotten that way because you inherited wealth from your parents, but it is far more likely that you are pretty good at what you do and have worked very hard for 25 &#x2013; 30 years or longer to get there.<br>
Statistically, you are likely to be over 45 years old and about to enter the most important and lucrative years of your career. One thing in your favour is that your timing is impeccable. The beginning of your adult working life coincided with one of the most prosperous cycles in Australian history and you have prospered with it by maximising the opportunities offered to you.  Successful investment, like most other rational objectives in life, depends on setting achievable goals and then working out a strategy to achieve them. For most Australians in their 40s or 50s this has become a process of working out the lump sum they will need on the day they retire in order to invest it to deliver today&#x2019;s income. But is this really an adequate answer to an anticipated lifetime of up to 80 years?  But the process can be complex, and there are many traps for the unwary.  Mistakes can be costly, even devastating!</p>
