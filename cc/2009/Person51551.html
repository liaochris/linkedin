            <h2>JRob Zetelumen&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Taking a few minutes to look at my list of previous experiences, the one thing that they all have in common is that I am not content to be just one of the people in the crowd. I always end up behind the scenes, making things happen. Now I am ready to take my career to a new level.<br>
<br>
Since moving to the Twin Cities, I have been involved with on-line community building with local non-profits. An anthropologist friend studying these groups noted that before my arrival there was practically no on-line activity. Since my arrival, activity has just exploded. She had just completed her dissertation, and is now having to write an addendum.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
<br>
For 24 years I was a house painter in Sioux City, Iowa. I worked in people&#x2019;s homes, and therefore worked directly with the customers. Our customer base was primarily made up of the most demanding people in the city, and I learned to work with them to make sure that they were satisfied. This meant listening to their desires and helping them to understand their options. So although my training was ostensibly as a painter, it was also a customer service position. So the transition to a customer service or sales position is not as significant as it might initially appear.<br>
<br>
After falling off a roof (luckily sustaining no permanent injuries) I realized that being a house painter was not the job I wished to do for the rest of my life. I examined my previous jobs and found that I enjoy developing my personal skills to better work with the needs of customers, or whoever the audience for the job is. I have a well rounded set of experiences having managed employees, organized databases, written for assorted publications, learned the skills of desktop publishing, and much more. Every job I have had, I have quickly mastered the skills of that job and been promoted. I have always been regarded as a valuable employee. I expect to bring something special to whatever job I acquire.

    <p class="description">This was a temporary assignment through Dolphin Staffing services and lasted from August 26 to September 15. I worked at the register to help with the rush of students at the beginning of the semester. I did check out and returns. When things were slow, I checked to make sure that merchandise was where it was supposed to be in the displays, that things behind the counter were organized, and generally stayed busy and productive. At the end of the gig, they gave me a bonus for consistent work.</p>

    <p class="description">I started working in the Rust Consulting call center Thursday November 13, and the job ended January 7. I also worked there from March 13 to April 13, and June 24 to July 7. This was a temporary staffing assignment through Prostaff. This job has allowed me to develop my phone skills. I've also enjoyed the experience of interoffice networking. I figured out several techniques to increase the cohesiveness of my working group, which helped increase our effectiveness due to an increased sharing of knowledge. I prided myself on never being late, never taking long lunches, rarely feeling the need for breaks, taking more calls than anyone else in the group, always striving to truly understand the material to better help the callers, and always being polite to the callers. Although this was only a temporary assignment, I feel very good about this work experience.</p>

    <p class="description">I am a fourth generation house painter. My father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all house painters. I was apprenticed to my father at the age of 14. From then until 2008, no matter what else I did I was also a house painter for the rich and fussy. I learned painting, staining, varnishing, wallpaper hanging, taping drywall, texturing, faux finishing techniques including woodgraining and marbleizing, spray techniques, and pretty much all the things that any old-school painter could be expected to know. I also became proficient at estimating and managing employees.<br>
<br>
We never advertised. All our business was from recomendations. We were known for such excellent work, and positive interactions with our customers, that having us do someone's work was something of a status symbol.<br>
<br>
My brother also started off working here and credits the training he received (attention to detail, hard work and commitment to meeting exacting standards quickly) to his success as a neurosurgeon.</p>

I performed normal managerial duties; scheduling, tracking inventory, ordering, tracking salary/hours/overhead, maintaining the budget, hiring, training, facility oversight, and being the final stop for all issues concerning the store. The job taught me a lot about managerial responsibility. I also had daily phone work, making courtesy calls to remind them that their videos were due. These calls were potentially awkward since they most certainly indicated that people would have late fees, and so they were an excellent opportunity to develop my phone skills.</p>

    <p class="description">I worked with candidates, worked with supporters, registered voters, set-up the office, continued managing phone banks, developed my public speaking abilities and organized the most detailed database that the county party had ever had. After 9 months working in politics, I came to realize that politics was not a good match for my values. I don't think that's a bad thing.</p>

    <p class="description">I was hired as the receptionist, but then organized the databases, coordinated volunteers, ran the phone banks (managed volunteers, wrote scripts, trouble-shot any issues that arose), drove the car in parades, and so many other things that the campaign manager decided that I needed a new job title. This job followed six years of volunteering, primarily in phone banks, and ten years of developing my public speaking abilities.<br>
<br>
In this job, as in most of my jobs and personal projects, I created impressively comprehensive databases. Just as a core part of my personality, I gather information and organize it into a form which is useful for other people just as side projects while performing my other duties. It never takes long before I am the go-to guy for useful current information.</p>
