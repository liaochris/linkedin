            <h2>Christopher Gomez&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Chris Gomez is considered by many the second-coming of Steve Jobs. His Vulcan-like intelligence, Covey-like wisdom and Toffler-like insight make up the ultimate package every little executive boy &amp; executive girl wish they'd get for Christmas. He is, for lack of a better word, phenomenal.<br>
<br>
Lee Iaccoca would hire Chris for his marketing genius.<br>
<br>
Sir Richard Branson would hire Chris to run his (future) social &amp; environmental enriching projects company called &quot;Virgin Infinity&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ted Turner would hire Chris for his ability to fix under performing P&amp;Ls.<br>
<br>
Stan Shih would hire Chris to help redesign the future of Acer and its product line.<br>
<br>
Christopher Nolan would hire Chris to be part of his SFX design team for The Dark Knight.<br>
<br>
And 'The Artist Formerly Known As Prince' would hire Chris to help him change his name to something more sophisticated sounding like 'My Name Is Earl'.<br>
<br>
Of course he wrote all the above in the the voice of the third person, just so he'd sound dignified... like all the other (self-written) profiles here.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>
<br>
I'm always open to discussing leadership roles in organizations that value the creation of exciting products/services, integrity and the entrepreneurial spirit. I've been blessed thus far with the experience of working in various organizations with fast-paced environments, and the opportunity to lead dynamic teams.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I'm actively involved in industry building - I lecture at universities (on the subjects of participatory media, blogging, internet media policy, and documentary/short film development), and am invited by government &amp; industry organizations to share ideas on new media policy development.<br>
<br>
If you seek a confident leader who's a go-getter, and enjoys nurturing &amp; encouraging innovative ideas within a team for your operations, please feel free to contact me. I'm also available for speaking engagements should you need me to cover topics related to emergent media, industry scenarios, etc.

    <p class="description">Together with Prof. Dr. Faridah Ibrahim (Dean of School of Communication) from the National University of Malaysia, formed the committee to kick off projects with the Ministry of Information (Government of Malaysia), to nurture the development of interaction-based Internet content.<br>
<br>
This project initially involved getting all public and private university/colleges to generate content within their own circle of concern and share them over the internet. In the process, I have put together simple milestones to help the project evolve - by proposing that these &quot;communities&quot; also develop their own video podcasts and release them through this same medium.</p>
