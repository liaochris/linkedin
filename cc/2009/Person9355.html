    <p class="description">Not actively working on Mataitech Products at this time. But do own the IP and technology and my run my upcoming book through the company.<br>
<br>
I worked on the NAUET product other software tools and HW/SW co-development training. I as part of that I presented at the 9th Software Design for Medical Devices in San Diego, CA November 2007. I presented &quot;Getting Embedded Software Working On The First Time - Case Studies From The Semiconductor And Medical Device Industries&quot;.<br>
<br>
I did the initial work on our first software product called NAUET. I personally designed the import engine importing from Verilog and VHDL to IP-XACT and did the initial coding for the code generation portions of the software including, Verilog, VHDL, SystemC and C/C++.  I personally put in place most of the engineering infrastructure. I created the initial architect of several digital designs and setup the development environment and did all the initial Verilog coding as well as 3rd party IP integration. I also have done RTOS porting and development. I licensed C/Verilog co-simulation technology which I personally wrote.</p>

    <p class="description">I was a lead for initial device bring up and initial diagnostics from the ASIC group and was responsible for making the transition from the ASIC group to software group go smoothly. Helped in developing the group and contributed to improving the Direct Path product line.   I developed and implemented the co-simulation environment for the ASIC development group and the software group while allowing for improved test coverage with shorter test development times. I am actively contributed code for the on chip firmware, diagnostics and Verilog code to the projects of was involved with. I also was actively involved with code quality improvement with both the hardware and software groups and trying to identify performance bottle necks as well as architected and implemented hardware and software solutions to these bottlenecks. I was heavily involved with test automation development and making sure those tests rolled from simulation into the lab on the prototype FPGA and then ASIC.</p>

I was responsible for all cross platform hardware interfaces and managed all the personnel to make that happen. I had as many as nine direct reports. I had both responsibilities for day-to-day management as well as technical management. Under my management we had improved software quality and performance on both our IAD and MSAP product lines. Responsibilities had also included management of several board developmentswhich included both new hardware and the associated software. Highlights included improving our IAD Ethernet traffic performance by nine fold while halving the CPU utilization (I was personally involved with the driver redesign and reorganizing the hardware software balance as well as managing the others involved) and major voice quality improvements across all of our products (I was personally involved with many of the code changes as well as managing the others involved).</p>

    <p class="description">I was technical lead on developing PMC-Sierra's long-term business plan for software. I also continued develop software for the AAL1 SAR (Aal1gator).  I developed the packet drivers for PMC&#x2019;s frame relay chips (FREEDM-NG). On the FREEDM-NG chip I developed one driver that supported all four variants of the chip. I then supported the driver through its early chip respins. Additional responsibilities have included pre and post sales support. I worked with customers to make the transition from IgT to PMC as painless as possible. Other involvements have included expanding the use of automated testing of both hardware and software. In addition I managed contractors for the development of other drivers such as PMCs next generation policing and shaping chips.</p>

Other developments have included being the primary developer and technical lead for many of IgT's other drivers including IgT's highly successful AAL1 SARs, many UNI chips, UPC chips and others. I am quiet familiar with ATM networking and its complexities such a traffic management, this while staying close to the hardware.
