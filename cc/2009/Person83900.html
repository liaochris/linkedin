            <h2>Richard Tabor Greene&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have developed perhaps the most comprehensive, practical curriculum in creativity applied to invention, discovery, design, and business venturing in the world--12 courses, tested with my Chinese and Japanese undergrads.  I can sometimes transform passive East Asians into more bold innovative styles. <br>
<br>
I am gradually redoing major design areas, putting them on a scientific research-able basis, by grounding them in my 60 models of creativity (see scribd.com for an article presenting all 60).   <br>
<br>
I want to establish a publishing-of-readings new industry of publishing, where classic and specialist readings of texts and related books on a topic area are published as works in their own right, getting around derivative work areas of copyright law by certain innovative treatments of topic ordering and naming.   <br>
<br>
I set up mass workshop events, such as my Invent Events in which sets of 200 people in 3 days generate 100 patents for a firm.   These events are 40 or more workshops daily going on in parallel with each workshop making a different product, using procedures derived from world best experts, and the products combining to make powerful overall results.   <br>
<br>
I have invented a new technology of meeting, face to face and across electronic networks, called Social Automata, wherein excitement replaces boredom in meetings.   It is based on using people as if processors in a parallel array of computers, assigning particular mental roles to them, and linking the roles in interesting topologies to maximize quality.   <br>
<br>
I have invented certain regularized fractal interfaces, one to replace all prose writing, another to replace web 2.0 browsers, another to replace current workgroup electronic cooperation topologies.   <br>
<br>
Structural cognition is a set of methods I have invented for allowing people to apply ordinary mental operators to 64 or 128 ideas, in the same time and with the same quality of outcome as they now apply those operators to 4 or 6 ideas.
              </p>
              <h3>Richard Tabor Greene&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
              <p class="skills">
                About half my U of C MBAs said my classes were &quot;life changing&quot;.   I try to be an inspirational leader who distributes management functions using structured workshop events that get employees to apply management functions to themselves. I wrote methods books for educatedness, effectiveness, creativity, managing complexity, managing culture, managing self, managing cities, super selling, managing technological innovation, 45 models of innovation, 64 dynamics of hi tech ventures.

WRITE UP THE STORY/COMEDY OF YOUR OWN BUSINESS ADVENTURES. Business History, Philosophy, Literature, Culture, Design<br>
31 = The Philosophy of Business:  what is debt, profit, expense, risk, service, consumption, spectating, wealth, happiness, motive, care, worth; un-admitted assumptions and culture roots of business blindspots and gender excesses in business performance cultures; <br>
32 = The History of Business:  history as where people admit truths about business,  stories that repeat every 8 years in global economies, errors admitted only in histories; <br>
33 = The Literature of Business:  telling the story of your own business tragedies and comedies; capturing the emotional dilemmas and absurdities of delusionally rational leaders<br>

    <p class="description">When I joined, people were selling two half million dollar each software AI projects to Wall Street firms a year for $1million average per partner in sales.   These were large projects that did not come in in time and none were profitable.   I fixed this immediately by selling 30 $100,000 each shorter simpler less risky projects to drug firms in New Jersey, then to Wall Street firms in Manhattan.   I toured companies, interviewed managers, spotted 30 application AI could do, got volunteer workgroups to extract the needed knowledge, set up 4 hours of weekly training and two programming weeks where expert programmers put that knowledge into code.  The result I sold two $3million projects my first year--six times the best previous sales by partners.</p>

    <p class="description">2000 sales persons had sold nothing to GM, EDS's largest customer (and owner) in 2 years.   I was hired as programmer but I instead tackled the biggest problem my company had.   I mitigated the rather militarist culture of EDS that was making sales fail and invented a Solution Culture, that was more feminine--listening not talking, admitting weakness not bragging, praising customer expertise not presenting only our own expertise, etc.    We created one day mass workshop events of 30 GM engineers presenting possible AI project solutions to this year GM priorities in the morning, each matched by working software application demos from non-EDS companies in the afternoon.  Remarks by viewing GM managers were transcribed and published to top 2000 managers of the  GM division.  Result, after 3 events, $16 million in software sales, the first sales by anyone other than Ross Perot.   As a result the Chairman arranged US government further work for my group .</p>

    <p class="description">While studying for 3 grad degrees at U of Michigan I consulted when possible.  Procter &amp; Gamble heard a Yankee group presentation I made on Japan entering US markets and they were interested at me learning things from my years in Japan that their managers had not learned.    I was hired to tell them how to keep Kao out of P&amp;G's North American markets.   I did a video, shown to some managers till the chairman of Kao bought Jerkins and stood on its front saying he would bury P&amp;G in 20 years.  That made my video popular with vice-chairman Laco who mandated that all see it.  We took videos of P&amp;G managers denying the message of a Japan threat, and that  changed the culture and provoked P&amp;G's initiative to wed systems with Walmart before Kao did that.    I started the initiative to link systems with Walmart with my videos--I had a lot of help in doing that from P&amp;G insiders.</p>

    <p class="description">I asked Huston Smith (of Dalai Lama fame) at MIT for an organization &quot;rebuilding Western civilization&quot;.  He gave me a phone number in Framingham, Mass.  I joined and visited 50 different North American cities each year, visiting the 20 richest families per city, raising funds, for three years.   Then I designed workshop procedures for mass workshop events of 2000 people meeting in 200 parallel daily workshops for 30 consecutive days.    I also set up participatory town meetings in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and parts of Europe.   I doubled per capita income of Korea's poorest village by importing portable mowers that ended harvest suffering for 7 weeks/year of village women and cash income the thusly liberated women got caused envy in men which caused men to get interested in other development tactics.</p>

    <p class="description">1. If, knowing when and where someone was raised and educated, you can predict nothing at all about what he does, thinks, and believes, he is an educated man. 2. We grow, become &quot;educated&quot; by learning to &quot;have&quot; what we used to naturally &quot;be&quot;--opinions, gender styles, nationality, and other aspects of our born identities.  For example, if I be what I was born, naturally and easily, I am somewhat un-trustable---too many liabilities of who and where I happened to be raised appear.  We all learn to have what we were born as---having our gender, having our nationality, having our profession or social class---we learn to manage the virtues and liabilities of each aspect of who we were born to be.  3. There are at least 60 diverse models of what being creative is--actions taken to make yourself &quot;more creative&quot; if based on no particular model, undo more creation than they create.</p>

Asked by a history of Japan professor to find 4 prefigurings of Meiji Japan in Tokugawa Japan I presented him, a week later, 566 prefigurings by applying industrial productivity methods to normal academic work.

<br>
Found in theories of history writing how contemporary frameworks greatly distort and limit amounts of historic reality available in history writings.   We see the past through current concerns, concepts, biases.  We project a story of what &quot;went on then and there&quot; rather than &quot;perceiving&quot; what went on then and there.</p>
