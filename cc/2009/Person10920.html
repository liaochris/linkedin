    <p class="description">Through dedication and hard work in partnership with United States Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congressman Vic Fazio, Congresswoman Susan Molinari, and others, secured passage of the Stamp out Breast Cancer Act in July 1997 and issuance of the historic Breast Cancer Research Semi-postal Stamp in July 1998.  <br>
<br>
Featured speaker at a White House ceremony for the Breast Cancer Research Stamp's first day of issuance on July 29, 1998 hosted by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Spearheaded efforts in securing legislation in July 2000, extending the issuance of the special fundraising Breast Cancer Research Stamp for two additional years.  <br>
<br>
Organized the nationwide effort to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp&#x2019;s issuance for two years beyond the first extension, working with Congress to pass a third consecutive piece of legislation, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act of 2001.  Helped to secure additional extensions in January 2004, October 2005 and December 2007, resulting in over $70 million raised to date for breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense.  With more than 830 million Breast Cancer Research Stamps sold to date, the public awareness raised as a result of this special stamp continues to save lives and is priceless.<br>

The organization she founded and currently runs...provides essential support services for cancer survivors in communities across the country....<br>
<br>
I first became acquainted with Betsy when she joined me in a campaign to create a first-of-its-kind postage stamp to fund breast cancer research.  She organized and led a team of volunteers who tirelessly made phone calls to Congress and pressed the issue forward.  Betsy personally flew to Washington and visited dozens of Congressional offices.  With Betsy&#x2019;s instrumental help, the Breast Cancer Research stamp became law in 1997 and so far has raised over $22 million.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, Betsy has twice successfully worked with my office to reauthorize the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. <br>
<br>
&#x2026;Betsy&#x2019;s commitment to fighting breast cancer comes from personal experience.  At the age of 33, she came down with the disease.  She deserves all of our admiration for channeling her personal trauma into a powerful crusade to stop breast cancer.<br>
<br>
&#x2026;She works tirelessly as a health care advocate, she has great community outreach skills, and &#x2013; most importantly &#x2013; she gets things done.  I give Betsy my highest recommendation.&#x201d;<br>

    <p class="description">The Breast Buddy Breast Care Program is a multidisciplinary effort of physicians, nurses, administrative staff, and community activists to inform and support breast cancer patients throughout their continuum of care.<br>
<br>
The information and social support provided was intended to affect four components of the Health Belief Model.  <br>
<br>
1) Perceived benefits of breast cancer treatment were addressed by clearly defining the treatment decision-making process and the patient's role in this process.<br>
<br>
 2) The guidance provided for the treatment decision-making process included step-by-step information intended to cue patients to action. <br>
<br>
3) Patients' self-efficacy was addressed by verbal reinforcement and empathetic support intended to reduce anxiety. <br>
<br>
4) Perceived barriers to breast cancer treatment were overcome by reassurance and countering misinformation. Interactions with  with newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were explicitly designed to incorporate four broad types of social support: emotional (empathy), instrumental (tangible services), informational, and appraisal (affirmation). <br>

The Breast Buddy Program has been identified as a best practice by the Commonwealth Fund and the American Association of Health Plans.  Representing over 130 million health plan members throughout the US, AAHP&#x2019;s recognition established the program as &#x201c;an exemplary practice&#x2026;an outstanding women&#x2019;s health program that really is making a difference in improving women&#x2019;s health.&#x201d;  Under  Mullen&#x2019;s leadership, this award-winning program was brought into the lives of medically indigent and underserved patients in a successfully completed pilot program at two LA County run hospitals, reaching medically underserved and indigent populations historically disconnected from the comprehensive health care services and psychosocial support they so desperately need.</p>

&#x201c;Betsy Mullen first came to Washington in 1996 with the goal of enacting the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. She knew no one and had no legislative experience.  There had been no other stamps in United States history dedicated to raising funds for a special cause, and there was no compelling reason to believe that Betsy's project was poised for success. Yet the following year, the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act was signed into law.  The Stamp has now been reauthorized four times, raised almost $60 million for breast cancer research and increased breast cancer awareness. Its expiration date - originally set for 2000 - has been pushed back to 2011.  The impressive success of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp is a testimony to Betsy Mullen. She is effective and tenacious.  Few people could have accomplished Betsy's extraordinary results, and she has done it all with class and grace.  Betsy is also the consummate team player.  It has truly been a privilege and pleasure to work with her.&#x201d; <br>

    <p class="description">&#x201c;Betsy is indefatiguable. She was incredibly powerful as a brainchild and lobby power behind the Breast Cancer Stamp. Dianne always gave her kudos for her untiring work to make this amazing stamp -- which has raised millions for research -- a reality.&#x201d; <br>

&quot;Betsy is an incredibly dedicated, hard working, and giving person. She has gone out of her way to help those affected by breast cancer, including my friend, who was recently diagnosed. Betsy took the initiative to provide assistance with the managed healthcare organization and physicians in order to ensure the best care possible. I feel truly grateful that Betsy has stepped into our lives at this most critical time. She is truly a selfless person that has devoted her life to helping others and has made a significant contribution to support ongoing research.&quot;<br>

    <p class="description">Ms. Mullen created WIN ABC to empower breast cancer patients to become informed partners with their healthcare team. A second key objective was to work with healthcare providers and policymakers to ensure responsible healthcare policy, appropriate delivery systems and pathways of care for breast cancer screening and treatment services and culturally competent education and psychosocial support for patients.<br>
<br>
Mullen worked to ensure equal access to appropriate, high quality breast cancer education, screening and treatment services for individuals from all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Betsy was actively involved in the establishment of the first breast cancer treatment fund in the US for patients at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, helping to raise over $65 million for this benchmark program.<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201c;As a volunteer with WIN over many years, I witnessed the dedication, professionalism and intensity that Betsy demonstrated while helping thousands of women cope with the myriad of decisions that they had to make facing breast cancer. I feel that it is mainly due to her determination that the United States post office issued a breast cancer stamp. I think that any organization or business would be fortunate to have Betsy as part of their staff.&#x201d; <br>

~ Charles/ June Kaufman, retired, County of Los Angeles Public library was with another company when working with Betsy at WIN Against Breast Cancer<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201c;Betsy was Co-founder of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp.  Her legislative skills are exemplary.  Also, Betsy founded Women's Information Network Against Breast Cancer (WIN-ABC), a highly effective peer support program. As part of that program, she began the Breast Buddies program at several southern California Kaiser Permanente facilities.  This program demonstrated the great value of peer support and the potential for patient-to-patient education regarding breast cancer.&#x201d; <br>
