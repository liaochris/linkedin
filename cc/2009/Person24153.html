            <h2>David Griscom&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have discovered and/or extensively characterized virtually all known intrinsic and extrinsic radiation-induced point defects in pure and lightly doped silica (glassy SiO2), alkali borate and silicate glasses, and heavy-metal fluoride glasses by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry.  Most significantly, I've discovered and characterized by ESR and optical methods the most fundamental defects in silica glass, the self-trapped holes (STHs). I've also made profound experimental and mathematical contributions the study of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of ferro- or ferri-magnetic particles precipitated in glasses, including lunar-soil glasses. Of great importance to both ESR and FMR, I derived (apparently for the first time) a closed-form expression for the temperature dependence of the ESR (or FMR) intensity for any value of the electronic spin S of isolated ions (or the calculated effective spin J of ferro-/ferri-magnetic particles of any given diameter) -- this solution turning out to comprise a weighted sum of the Brillouin function and its first and second dervatives. I've also elucidated the roles of radiolytic atomic hydrogen and STHs in the post-irradiation buildup of interface states in MOS transistors (the fundamental elements in most computer chips) and developed the mathematics of fractal kinetics, demonstrating its governing role in the radiation-induced creation and thermal decay of point defects in pure- and doped-silica optical fibers subjected to ionizing radiations.  More recently, I've made highly innovative contributions to the geology of major impacts on the earth.<br>
<br>
I am principal author of 109 of my 188 published works, a body which is highly cited by my peers according to my score (h=39) on the Hirsch index:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_number <br>

    <p class="description">I was officially appointed to this position, but the budgeted 1/4-time Arizona state funding failed to come through ...which was just as well, since I spent the first half of the academic year working to avert the re-election of George W. Bush and the second half working to expose poll-worker fraud in Tucson, a microcosm of the means by which Karl Rove stole the presidency for Dubya a second time.  I've published the latter story as a chapter in the book edited by Mark Crispin Miller, &quot;Loser Take All -- Election Fraud and the Subversion of Democracy, 2000-2008&quot; (as of the morning of 10/23/08 Amazon.com Sales Rank: #448 in all Books, #1 in Books &gt; Nonfiction &gt; Current Events &gt; Conspiracy Theories' #2 in Books &gt; Nonfiction &gt; Government &gt; Elections, #2 in Books &gt; Nonfiction &gt; Politics &gt; Political Parties).  Unfortunately, my chapter was redacted by the publisher to make it more reader-friendly to those without strong mathematical backgrounds.  However, the uncut version including the results of my original binomial analysis can be downloaded here: <br>

    <p class="description">Short stays such as this result when university money for the purpose happens to coincide with the convenience of a potential visitor; in this case we happened to be living in Paris that year. There are never any prescribed duties, so I insisted in giving 3 lectures at the university (and also one at Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon). At my last university lecture, some new faces turned up in the seminar room, and one of them gave a talk following mine, also on defects in silica glass. These were two professors from the University of St-Etienne and some of their grad students, one of whom, Sylvan Girard, was the second speaker. This felicitous meeting ultimately led to my serving on Sylvain's Ph.D. thesis jury, and later on I agreed to be a reporter on the thesis of Kader M&#xe9;djahdi. I was also later invited for a 6-week invited professor of research stint at Universit&#xe9; Jean Monnet Saint-&#xc9;tienne in 2004 (see above).</p>

    <p class="description">I performed self-directed basic research, mainly related to self-trapped holes in silica, at TIT's Materials and Structures Laboratory.  I analyzed and published those data two years later. While at TIT, I presented several PowerPoint lectures there and elsewhere in Japan, including three talks at the International Symposium on New Prospects of ESR Dosimetry and Dating in Osaka.<br>

The Osaka conference was run by Prof. Motoji Ikeya of Osaka University, who consented to having his students use the marvelous scanning-ESR &quot;macroscope&quot; that he had developed to run a telling experiment on one of the rocks that I argue are ejecta from the Chesapeake Bay crater.  Relevant to the very same story, Prof. Ken-Ichi Kondo, whose office was a few floors above mine at TIT, agreed to have his students run an experimental shocking experiment that appears to show that ferric oxyhydroxides can be vitrified by shock waves.  Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way to do proper materials science on this unique sample.  (If anyone should be interested, I would be happy to provide a portion of the sample.)</p>

    <p class="description">Actually, my stint at Universite de Paris 6/Laboratoire de Min&#xe9;ralogie et Cristallographie de Paris was broken up into 3 stays totaling only 4 months, during which I performed self-directed research employing ESR to probe impact debris in Cretaceous-Tertiary(KT)-boundary rocks with the objects of (1) better understanding various material phases generated in the impact process on time scales of minutes to hours and (2) developing ESR evidence for changes in sea-water chemistry and species extinctions on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years above and below this signal geologic time horizon.<br>
<br>
By extraordinary coincidence there was another visiting professor there also using ESR to study KT-boundary materials.  Surely we were the only two scientists in the world doing this at this time!  Fortunately for both of us though, Pavle Premovic (Department Head at the University of Nis, Serbia) was looking at entirely different set of paramagnetic species than I was, and we were able to amicably share both spectrometer time and samples. We became great pals!</p>

    <p class="description">Total funding: $125 K. By my reckoning (and that of my peeved bosses who had to pick up my salary when I didn't have outside funding), I delivered far more than the DOE paid for here. I developed and heavily employed an innovative CCD-camera prism spectrometer (idea and prototype due to Charles Askins) to record simultaneously the optical transmission of 4 silica-core/F-doped-silica-clad/Al-jacketed fiber-optic coils and their pigtails (differing one from the other in their OH, Cl, and F contents) and 4 reference fibers (identical fibers but pigtails only, without coils) during continuous fixed-dose-rate gamma irradiation of the coils in NRL's &quot;swimming pool&quot; source at selected times stretching from 30 seconds to 6 months -- an unusual capability that revealed unexpected defect-related optical bands, the relationships they may have to the anionic impurities, and their creation and decay kinetics. I had reason to believe that a fiber with an F-doped silica core might be superior and so should be one of the 4 tested, but because no such fiber was commercially available I contracted with Konstantin Golant at the Fiber Optic Research Center in Moscow to fabricate this fiber using an F-doped-silica core rod from Japanese industry kindly provided by Hideo Hosono at Tokyo Institute of Technology. (I believe this to have been the first ever contract issued by NRL to an entity of the former-Soviet Union.) My data reduction procedure consisted of transferring hundreds of raw CCD-camera transmitted-light &quot;streaks&quot; onto spreadsheets where I converted them to gamma-ray-induced visible/infra-red spectral loss in dB/km vs wavelength in nm. Several of the 7 papers I principally authored that presented, analyzed, and interpreted these data are still widely cited by researchers around the world seeking to find out if a sufficiently rad-hard optical fiber really can be developed for use in or near a functioning fusion reactor.</p>

    <p class="description">I worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in Arlington, VA, on a voluntary half-time assignment from the Naval Research Laboratory.

One of the programs that I inherited from a former incumbent of my desk at the Defense Sciences Office was the infamous space-laser program.  I was so underwhelmed by what I was shown during a site visit that I had thoughts of canceling the program ...a decision that was lifted from my shoulders shortly thereafter by Congress' passing of a line-item continuation of this historically unsuccessful program.</p>

    <p class="description">I took sabbatical leave from the Naval Research Laboratory to spend a year at Universit&#xe9; Claude Bernard Lyon 1, FRANCE. I picked Lyon because I had struck up friendships with faculty members and students of the university's D&#xe9;partement de Physique des Mat&#xe9;riaux while attending a 1973 NATO Summer School in Corsica. However, by the time I arrived there, everyone was involved with completing theses (I served on the jury of the late Jacques Pivot), moving into new buildings, and/or wiring up a Van de Graff accelerator down in the basement. Little chance for me to do hands-on research. So, besides giving several seminars there (as well as in Paris, Strasbourg, and Toulouse), I wrote two lengthy review articles, one an invited chapter on the atomic structure of borate glasses (which, following a proposition by Norbert Kreidl, was exposed IN ADVANCE to all attendees of the first Conference on Boron in Glass and Glass Ceramics held at Alfred University in 1977, where I was the keynote speaker ...reviewing the works of these very attendees!).  The other review treated an immense literature of experimental data and theoretical calculations that had all of a sudden popped into existence (like the &quot;big bang&quot;) regarding the electronic structures of both crystalline and glassy polymorphs of silicon dioxide.  While this field has advanced considerably since then, I believe that my 80-page treatise likely remains a standard reference for students and researchers just entering the field.</p>

    <p class="description">By the time NASA accepted my proposal to perform ESR studies of glassy materials returned from the Moon, it had already funded 2 other groups to do the same, and arguments over the nature of the so-called &quot;characteristic resonance&quot; of the lunar soils were raging. At first I thought it was paramagnetic, but I finally had to agree with one of the other PIs that it is due to FERROmagnetic resonances. But FMR of what? I decided that my co-investigators and I should try to simulate this resonance by creating a suite of simulated lunar glasses in the laboratory (under correct redox conditions) and then subjecting them to various treatments designed to mimic lunar surface processes. We finally concluded that 65 - 75% of the &quot;characteristic resonance&quot; was due to single-domain (SD) metallic iron particles precipitated in glasses and attributed the rest to SD magnetite. Our biggest successes were (1) creating a simulated lunar glass with an FMR spectrum exactly matching the bizarre spectrum of an Apollo 11 black glass chip, (2) theoretically explaining the spectra of (1) as due to 2-domain metallic iron, (3) Chuck Marquardt's and my experimental evidence for a new mechanism of lunar-surface maturation darkening, (4) our virtually perfect experimental mimicking of the FMR spectra of lunar volcanic glasses by sub-solidus oxidation of the simulated glasses, and (5) my theoretical explanations of the (contrasting) temperature dependencies of the FMR intensities and linewidths of SD iron and magnetite particles. Unfortunately for us, the volcanic glasses were not widely recognized as such at the time, so our excellent evidence for precipitated magnetite in the Apollo 15 green glass spherules (which history will surely agree with) was regarded by the mandarins of the time as evidence of &quot;high bias and incompetence.&quot; Thus our renewal proposal was rejected. Still, we published 20 papers on ESR/FMR of lunar materials in refereed journals &amp; conference proceedings, many of them seminal.</p>

    <p class="description">Jim Schulman, then Acting Director of Research at NRL, had conceived a program to study the fundamental physics and chemistry of glasses and was actively searching for candidates for NRL-NRC Posdoctoral Associates in this area.  Several grad-school buddies of mine at Brown had already been appointed NRL-NRC Associates (though not all in Jim's program), so I threw in my application and research proposal, and it was readily accepted as fitting in very well with Jim's vision.  This resulted in a virtually seamless continuation of kinds of glass research I had begun at Brown, i.e., exploiting the ESR technique to study radiation-induced paramagnetic defects and transition-group ions in glasses.  Although my post-doc was good for 2 full years, I was converted to a regular employee of the Solid State Division after 17 months (I couldn't understand why, since I viewed myself as inferior to virtually all my new colleagues).</p>

    <p class="description">I wrote a couple papers based on some of the research I did in grad school that didn't make it into my thesis, including one with my brother Robert, who as an employee of IBM was able to use one of their &quot;main frames&quot; to do some heavy duty theoretical computations to underpin my interpretations of my electron spin resonance (ESR) data for Mn2+ ions in borate glasses and polycrystalline compounds.  Amazingly (and without precedent!) Phil Bray took his name off that one because he decided he didn't have enough to do with it.  <br>
<br>
During this time I also advised and/or collaborated with some of Phil's remaining grad students who were using ESR to study paramagnetic defects in glasses, particularly Craig Taylor whose ESR (and NMR) line-shape-simulation computer program was indispensable to morphing the art of powder-pattern -- and &quot;glass-pattern&quot;! -- analyses into true science.  (As for me, I never learned to program anything larger than an HP hand calculator. So I ended up using Craig's program for nearly two decades on the Naval Research Laboratory's main-frame computer ...before finally switching to an equivalent program originated by Joe Friebele for use on PCs.)</p>

      <p class="notes">My thesis advisor was the late Phillip J. Bray, who earned his Ph.D. under Nobel Prize winner Norman Ramsey at Harvard. At Brown, Phil set up a magnetic resonance laboratory (NMR, PQR, and ESR) dedicated to glassy materials. By the time I joined his group, he was Chairman of the Physics Department and directing as many as 15 graduate students.  Predictably, he was unable to provide quality guidance to so many students, particularly those doing ESR, the technique he knew the least about.  So my de facto advisor became the late Sook Lee, a gruff, but brilliant and highly driven North Korean post doc had who dodged the draft during the Korean War and became translator for the first American troops to enter his town. Sook's advice was valuable, but none of the 5 or 6 projects I launched seemed important enough to me for a thesis. And since I deplored the thought of writing a patchwork thesis, it took me 6 years and a serious bout of depression to finally pick a thesis topic and realize it.</p>
