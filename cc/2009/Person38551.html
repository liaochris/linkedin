                UPDATE: If you are waiting for me to reply to you or rate responses to a question, please forgive the delay. I am in the process of moving to Scarborough, in Toronto, where I recently acquired a long term, corporate SEO (Search Engine Optimization) writing assignment. I am also managing a major SEO project for a medical doctor in Toronto. My work as a resume writer will also continue. I will not be taking on any new clients until after I move, but will be able to refer people to other resume writers in my network.<br>

I'm not going to waste this valuable space writing about my experience. I know people with 50 years' experience, none of it having the slightest value. As for achievements, most providers have them; and within each industry, most achievements resemble each other. <br>
<br>
My focus is on how I have distinguished myself from my colleagues and competitors. I did this as a Certified Professional Resume Writer by:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Publishing significantly both inside and outside my field<br>
&#x2022; Inventing the folded Business-Card Resume<br>
&#x2022; Being 1st in the world to create websites on the fly<br>
&#x2022; Offering clients a FREE website with most resume packages<br>
&#x2022; Hosting these sites FREE under a short URL<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Building attractive sites that are readable within 4 seconds on a slow modem<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Creating the world's largest web collection of samples by a certified resume writer, with over 80 documents<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Letting people get detailed info by calling A Real Live Person Twenty-Four Hours Seven Days&#xae;<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Successfully prosecuting applications for six trade-mark registrations &#x2014; one in US &#x2014; without hiring a trade-mark agent<br>
<br>
In so doing, I established and maintained relationships with people from an extremely wide range of ethnocultural backgrounds. This diversity is reflected in my LI network. <br>

    <p class="description">R&#xe9;su-Card&#xae; &#x2013; Established 1989 &#x2022; Registered 1990<br>
<br>
When I entered the workforce in 1966, the resume writing industry was in its infancy. No one cited achievements. Resumes were replete with boring job descriptions. Baby boomers were maturing. Competition was fierce. I knew instinctively I had to distinguish myself.<br>
<br>
From 1966 to 1989 I sold my services to employers in 30 successful interviews, two by phone. I did not learn this business by studying, but by doing. I probed employers for feedback on my resume, asked other job-seekers about their experiences, and worked in a personnel division in government.<br>
<br>
In 1980, I began writing resumes for friends and noticed they consistently got hired. In 1988, one suggested resume writing as an occupation. I put my resume on a business card. Not only did employers read it, but when I called them, they remembered it&#x2014;and me.<br>
<br>
The next year, I started a business around this concept, and it caught on.</p>
