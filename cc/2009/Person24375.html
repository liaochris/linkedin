              <p class="summary">
                Who else wants to make more money and have more fun doing exactly what they want to do each and every day?<br>
<br>
Everyday you wake up and make a conscious decision to go to work. You may not feel like you have a choice &#x2013; but you do. <br>
<br>
How do you feel when you make that decision?<br>
<br>
How does your family feel when, time and again you miss dinner or a soccer game or a special event?<br>
<br>
How do you think these feelings will impact your work with your clients?<br>
<br>
Your answers to these three questions will help to shape how you build your successful law firm or develop your successful professional practice.<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of attorneys and law firms in existence today:<br>
<br>
FREE Law Firms and FAKE Law Firms<br>
<br>
Your law practice or your professional service firm is either FREE or it&#x2019;s FAKE.<br>
<br>
A FREE Firm is: <br>
<br>
Fun &#x2013; You enjoy what you are doing and who you work with.<br>
Rewarding &#x2013; Your work helps fulfill your personal mission.<br>
Easy &#x2013; Your work comes naturally to you. <br>
Engaging &#x2013; Your firm magnetically attracts others.<br>
<br>
You know your business is FAKE if it is:<br>
<br>
Frustrating &#x2013; You can&#x2019;t seem to break through to the next level.<br>
Annoying &#x2013; Going to work bothers you.<br>
Killer &#x2013; Your business is literally taking years off of your life.<br>
Exhausting - You're tired all the time and you don&#x2019;t know why. <br>
<br>
My mission is to help FAKE firms become FREE firms. I do this by rearranging things that already exist in within you and within your span of control.<br>

    <p class="description">Dave Lorenzo was a senior leader within the firm.  He managed several hotels and directed recruiting, training and on-boarding for new General Managers.  He served as an internal consultant for preopening projects and sales, marketing and business development initiatives. <br>
<br>
Lorenzo's specialty was pre-opening projects and repositioning distressed assets.  He was considered to be a &quot;magician&quot; as he could turn an unprofitable business into a cash cow - often within 90 days. <br>
<br>
In this role, Lorenzo developed the Marriott Hotel at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.  He lead the start-up of this business and developed $5 million in annual revenue in 18 months. The business delivered a 40% return on investment by the end of year 2.<br>
<br>
Lorenzo also managed a portfolio of over $35 million in business assets.  This portfolio delivered a staggering net profit (over 20%) during his tenure.</p>
