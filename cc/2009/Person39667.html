              <p class="summary">
                http://heywhatever.info<br>
ROCK GOAL: To IMPACT LIVES - MAKE A DIFFERENCE !!!<br>
Kevin ROCK Reiss created HeyWhatEver in 1999 to achieve that purpose.<br>
HeyWhatEver GOAL: To become the Webs Premier Portal or &quot;SUPERPORTAL&quot; the only Portal of Portal of it's kind. Social Networking that is completely connecting the dots on the World Wide Web and taking this MEGA-TREND Paradigm Shift to &quot;THE NEXT LEVEL&quot; !! LinkedIN is an awesome tool for this.<br>
The HeyWhatEver Concept was created in 1999 and has developed a TEAM of Entrepreneurs, Developers, Contractors, Designers, Consultants, Partners, Resellers, and Affiliates unlike any group the (www.) has ever experienced. Never before has such an undertaking ever taken place. &quot;Good Help is HARD TO FIND&quot; is not only a clich&#xe9; in modern business but a fact. Our FOCUS &quot;weeding through talent&quot;, researching technology, trends, and the Internet non-stop for the betterment of the surfer... all in the name of &quot;Making the WEB a Better Place&quot;. The heartbeat of our HeyWhatEver SUPERPORTAL is to actually re-organize the Internet. For EXAMPLE: As highways are built on our US Interstate system, typically we come to find they are not efficiently flowing through a city as it continues to grow. This creates what we call TRAFFIC JAMS! No one enjoys being slowed down when they are attempting to arrive at a destination. Therefore a need to plan a major re-construction project typically becomes necessary for that flow of traffic to actually flow at maximum efficiency. Likewise we at HeyWhatEver have seen this challenge with the web. It has continued to grow at lightning speeds, while its many highways, roads, sidewalks, and paths have not connected, flowed, or even begun to move people from one road to the next in an efficient type manner. HeyWhatEver is The Road to Whatever... HeyWhatEver is your Road Map... YOUR Guide to The Information Super-Highway.

    <p class="description">The Original HeyWhatEverTV Domain for http://heywhatever.tv was purchased in 2002 when the .tv domain extension was introduced. The visionary idea of Kevin ROCK Reiss was similar to that of YouTube. Professing even before 2002 already in 2000 to HWE Clients the merging of Internet &amp; TV was inevitable and eventually you wouldn't need a separate unit as they would become one. Joining FORCES with Celebrity MASTER Bike Builder MONDO the GODFATHER of CHOPPERS, Reiss was able to write a script and develop never before seen footage of the Motorcycle Industry. 2 years worth has been produced and is at the editing phase which is called &quot;Miles with MONDO&quot;. The 1st Gig HWETV went after, they beat SPEED CHANNEL for developing 5 Reality TV Shows and a merchandising contract spearheaded by Reiss's negotiation skills.</p>
