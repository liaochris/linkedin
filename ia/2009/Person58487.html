    <p class="description">I am responsible for the development/support of Excel/Access based controls working as part of a small Surveillance &amp; Performance Analysis team that monitor the impact of Rating changes to the Bank's ABS positions. This team works closely with the Structured Investment Credit team (Risk), Investment Portfolio team (Front Office) and senior management, such as the Head of Credit Policy &amp; Sanctioning and the Head of Risk/Treasury.<br>
<br>
This is a technical role within the business area and as such demands a flexible approach with an ability to handle multiple programming/developing tasks within tight deadlines. Programming requirements are largely event-driven and typically require rapid application development to reflect changing business requirements in the systems. This happens, to a large extent as an iterative process involving the candidate and the team head.<br>
<br>
The Surveillance &amp; Performance Analysis team is responsible for monitoring the bank's huge structured finance portfolio - one of the largest in the market. The current portfolio under management contains approx. 1,400 Structured finance bonds.<br>
<br>
The team's wider audience are senior management, Lloyds/HBOS Group, up to executive level, as well as external clients such as institutional investors, rating agencies, FSA, accounting firms/auditors etc.<br>
<br>
The key systems used are two back end MS Access databases; the Surveillance Database and Portfolio Analytics Platform (comprising RATER &amp; Portfolio Reporter Modules) with various interfaces to source systems such as Murex Limit Controller, Summit and Bloomberg and Excel based front end reports.</p>

The effect on the P &amp; L could therefore be calculated and any significant differences highlighted, investigated and necessary action taken. These analytical tools were either Excel or Access/SQL Server based and some relied heavily on a suite of functions provided by BNP&#x2019;s in-house quants to create a set of daily reports, that were either tabular, formatted using XML style sheets, or customised in layout to meet the requirements of the Users.</p>

    <p class="description">This assignment required the re-engineering of a business critical Access database that was at the core of the Asset Securitisation business of Commerzbank. This database had to have a User Access rights matrix, Audit Trail functionality and the ability to operate within different User environments before IT could take over ownership from the Business for more stringent development methods and controls to be incorporated. At the same time, as the database was so poorly written 6 years ago, significant amounts of code had to be rewritten incorporating standard coding conventions, variable data type declarations, error handling and a general tightening up of loose procedures.<br>
<br>
Prior to the above, I was part of the XP 2003 rollout project team to provide a Development/Support resource for any upgrade issues encountered within Excel spreadsheets and Access databases for the Front Office Users of Debt Capital Markets and other business areas. The Users were being migrated from Access 97 to Access 2003, Excel 2000 to 2003 and from Windows NT4 to XP within an Active Directory environment being given a new PC along the way.<br>
<br>
Specifically, I worked with the Bank&#x2019;s in-house Support team during each User&#x2019;s UAT process for the testing of their Excel/Access files and correcting issues on the spot where possible, otherwise taking the issue away for more detailed analysis and rectification, deploying the corrected solution to the User when they went live under XP.<br>
<br>
Some of the issues encountered included: -<br>
&#x2022;	The rewriting of VBA code that automated the creation of Outlook e-Mails by using the CDO Object model that exposes the MAPI system avoiding the new warning dialog box created by the Outlook Security Guardian<br>
&#x2022;	Ensuring that all dependant add-ins or dll's that are required by a file are loaded and activated, notably blp.xla and blph.xla that were frequently not loaded correctly</p>

Although the core functionality was in place, important issues arose in connection with the run time length and Sensitivity analysis and I was able to show that by taking a different approach significant speed improvements could be made.</p>

    <p class="description">As budget constraints had eased was invited back and to start with, further enhanced the Excel analysis template for plate based Assays that I&#x2019;d developed previously and was able to improve its performance and set up times further by leveraging on the power of Pivot Charts and other advanced techniques.<br>
<br>
Developed an analysis template for Slow Wave Sleep that was able take the huge amount of raw data from a 12 hour period and analysis it from many different perspectives presenting the results in advanced charts, Pivot Tables and Data Tables to pull out from the mass of data the picture that was hidden within.<br>

    <p class="description">As part of the XP rollout project team, was asked to investigate the issues, and then formulate plans, for the upgrade of Excel spreadsheets and Access databases for 4,500 Users across all business areas. The Users were being migrated from Office 2000 Std to Office XP Std, Access 97 to Access 2000 and from Windows NT4 to XP within an Active Directory environment being given a new PC along the way.<br>
<br>
As the file formats are the same in both versions of Excel, the crux of the task was to ensure that the spreadsheets had all the components on their new PC that they were dependent upon to be able to function. Several third party applications were also being upgraded and these required intensive testing and VBA code enhancements to ensure that they worked after upgrade.<br>
<br>
For Access, the upgrade caused significant logistical problems as large numbers of databases were split with a GUI front end and data back end, shared across multiple User/business areas. Several papers published by MSDN surrounding the differences in file formats and other technical issues were informative, but a global strategy had to be developed to encompass the conversion process, arrange UAT testing and deployment methodology across the different business areas.<br>
<br>
These upgrade strategies for Excel and Access were adopted by the Steering Committee not only for the UK but also for the US, Singapore and Tokyo offices and were used when the first deployments started in late May.</p>

    <p class="description">Was responsible for the upgrade and conversion of Excel spreadsheets for 620 DEBT/GELP/IBK/Research Trader/Analysts during the REUTERS Kobra 3000 Xtra rollout project.<br>
<br>
Developed a Conversion Tool that automated the process of replacing existing Tibdde, Tiblink, Marketsheet and other formulae types that retrieved Reuters, and in-house, Real Time and Historical data with new functions that were available from the PowerPlus Pro analytical suite that came with the new package.<br>
<br>
Advanced VBA code was used to interrogate and amend existing VBA code found in Code Modules as well as nested Worksheet formulae. Log files were created that documented the upgrade processes to provide an Audit Trail, analyse the results, and generate a table of formulae to be converted manually.<br>
<br>
Ensured that the upgraded spreadsheets were deployed, and that any Support issues and enhancements required as a result of the process were carried out. Additionally used VBA code in Excel to manipulate the Outlook 97 Object Model to automate mailing processes.<br>
<br>
Along the way, any spreadsheets that were using the Marketsheet functionality were converted to Reuters too as it was in the process of being turned off.</p>

The output files from each of the VB apps was used by specialist robotic equipment to weigh or extract minute quantities of solutions for Analysis and Quality Control leading to eventual Production. All components and apps were safeguarded using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.<br>
<br>
Where required, the system employed the Windows API, including the dynamic management of network resources.  Error reporting was implemented by constructing XML documents to record detailed error information. XSL templates were used to present error details in HTML for on-screen review and printing.</p>
