    <p class="description">I supported the US Army Future Combat System (FCS) Project Management Office (PMO) which is a major modernization effort of the entire US Army form how the conduct combat operations to the materiel used during those operations.  We were brought in during the requirements development phase and implemented the RTM software package designed to assist and track the development of requirements from inception through development and testing.  In such a huge undertaking, it was essential to ensure every requirement could be tracked back to a use case and forward to features and testing.  This improved cost control measure enabled the US Army to demonstrate that every requirement was necessary and that there was no extra or unnecessary spending. During this effort I supervised a team of eight consultants and briefed senior Army officers at the executive level.</p>

    <p class="description">I graduated from the SAP Academy in Toronto Canada as an Application Consultant for SAP R/3 in the Sales and Distribution Module.  I then worked on the implementation of SAP for the US Army Logistics Modernization (LogMod) project.  My first assignment was to structure the Customer Master to meet all program requirements.  I was then assigned to configure SAP to implement several special order processes.  After a year on this effort, the prime contractor, CSC, restructured the consultant workforce significantly reducing the subcontractor workforce including myself.  This was a great introduction to large software/ERP implementation, software development control procedures, requirements development and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>

    <p class="description">I led a business process improvement project of US Army Personnel Administration offices at 14 posts across the US.  I supervised seven consultants from different geographic locations each of which developed a statement of work for non-governmental functions and then assisted the government workforce to develop Performance Work Statements (PWS) as their bids for the work.  This was done as part of the OMB A76 process to lower costs by contracting non-governmental work out to private firms when it was cost effective.  Our assistance helped ten of the 14 sites win their competitions. During this project I coordinated the efforts of the seven consultants, set up systemic methods of information exchange between geographically remote teams, oversaw the delivery of training to clients, and managed the personnel, financial, schedule and methodology implementation across all sites ensuring a comprehensive and coordinated service delivery.</p>

I managed a multiphase, complex project encompassing marketing, advertising, client contact, and client service processes to expand client base and improve return business. The project resulted in numerous innovations and improvements implemented across the agency to include reduced data entry error rates and reduced time per item receipt by over twenty percent.  Reengineered agency call center operations to align them with strategic goals and reduced overall response time by over sixty-percent.  Designed an Activity Based Costing (ABC) system with 1100+ activities that became the basis for the agency's new customer pricing strategy. Restructured field offices reducing them by almost half to significantly reduce operational costs with minimal operational disruption.</p>

    <p class="description">This was my introduction to the world of commerce and consulting.  I started by continuing the work I had been doing as a member of CTT's client, the Army's Training and Doctrine Command supporting the data integration of Army training systems.  I also had the opportunity to support the development of CTT's suite of IDEF modeling tools.  Particularly the Activity Based Costing application.  I was the lead functional expert on this project and it was a great introduction into the principles of requirements analysis and the SDLC. One lesson that hit home was to aim very high with requirements and systems development.  I was often surprised when developers told me, &quot;Yeah, we can do that.&quot;</p>

    <p class="description">I attend the Combined Arms Services Staff School (CAS-cubed as they called it) and then to a six-month course for Information Systems Officer training. With all of that, I was ready for my assignment to a General Officer Staff at the Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, VA.  My primary work there was attempting to integrate the data from many training information systems so that duplicate data entry could be eliminated.  It was also my first exposure to the role of project manager in an organization structure where I had to work with &quot;line managers&quot; cajoling and persuading them to support my project goals and initiatives.  This was a big lesson in the importance of seeing things from other perspectives and incorporating compelling business cases that demonstrated the direct benefits of a project for others in order to get them on board.</p>

    <p class="description">I commanded a special Infantry Company comprised of the non-artillery instructors for the basic trainees on Fort Sill. This included rifle marksmanship, first aid, radio-telephone ops, machine guns, squad tactics, hand grenades and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical warfare.  This unit operated the live-fire ranges. I'm proud that under my command there as not a single serious injury.  I did a lot of process management to a very high level of detail. To efficiently get through a day's training, every detail had to be choreographed, streamlined and deconflicted with maximum productivity and safety. It was another great learning opportunity for my future process reengineering jobs. During this period my Brigade Commander, now MG (Ret) Robert H. Scales Jr. rated me as the best Company Commander out of a group of 46 in his Brigade. MG Scales went on to a number of senior posts and now regularly provides commentary on warfare to the major networks, NPR, PBS and numerous publications.</p>

    <p class="description">After the Infantry Officer's Advanced Course, I became a certified instructor of tactics and Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield at Fort Sill, OK.  Teaching to groups of 200 plus at the collegiate level, this assignment was invaluable in developing a stage presence and public speaking techniques.  I revamped several courses learning a lot about training development. I noticed many classes had small reference sheets handed out that were needed by the students in subsequent classes.  We often supplied several copies throughout the course which was wasteful and caused shortages.  I proposed and developed a consolidated reference book used throughout the three-month course. The first edition was published six weeks later.  It reduced printing costs by almost half and the students had a take away reference.  Little did I know that this would be one of my first of many process improvement projects. It was during this assignment that I got my MBA during night school.</p>

    <p class="description">Upon graduation I became a 2nd Lieutenant of Infantry.  My first assignment was as a Rifle Platoon Leader in the 8th Infantry Division stationed in Baumholder Germany.  I spent three wonderful years in Germany and got the opportunity to do some travel around Europe.  I also held positions as the Battalion Adjutant, Scout Platoon Leader and Company Exec.  I earned my Expert Infantryman's Badge and also learned a lot about leadership, mechanized tactical warfare and management.  I was singled out to lead a hand picked color guard that retraced the steps of our 39th Regiment during WWII from the Normandy landing to Cherbourg and eventually to Paris where we participated in the 40th anniversary of the D-day landings.  I got a quick lesson in being a diplomat.  <br>
Even though it was on a small scale, it was still eye opening.</p>
