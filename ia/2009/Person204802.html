  </p>
    <p class="description">Central Calling primarily provides call direction services to companies with multiple locations, as well as VoIP telephone service to business and residential customers.<br>
<br>
A caller dials a single number, and then based on predefined criteria is transferred to one of your locations.<br>
<br>
A prime example is a pizza store.  Your customer dials a single number to reach your pizza chain and is automatically connected to the store closest to them or closest to the location they are heading.<br>
<br>
Other examples include: Real Estate Agents, Insurance Agents, Independent Sales Agents (Ie: Jafra, Mary Kay, Tupperware, etc), Drug Stores, Tobacco Stores, or really any &quot;chain&quot; that wants their customers to be able to quickly and easily find the locations nearest them.<br>
<br>
During the implementation of this application, we became intimately familiar with VoIP, Speech Recognition, and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) programming.</p>

    <p class="description">Email Media Group is an Email Service Provider.  We physically take an electronic newsletter you create and send it to your subscribers and then monitor and track to insure compliance with the CAN-SPAM act, as well as creating informative reports showing whose opened your newsletter, how many times they've viewed it, when they viewed it, and many other statistics.<br>
<br>
I took over development of the software in 2005 and &quot;made it work&quot;.  I wrote the entire billing system and the entire mail broadcasting system, as well as tons of core code to bring everything together.  We've added hundreds of features, and thousands of bug fixes in the first two years I worked on the project.<br>
<br>
Since then I've designed and implemented several patent-pending features that can not be found anywhere else in the world, worked on an easy-to-use drag &amp; drop WYSIWYG newsletter editor, and increased the speed and scalability of the system dramatically.</p>

We typically get contracts after a company has been turned away by dozens of other consultants who claim that whatever the company is trying to accomplish is not possible.  We pride on making things that are impossible a reality...<br>
<br>
We've built everything from large scale email systems, to high-end web applications capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users and multi-terrabyte databases.</p>

    <p class="description">Baby to Baby specialized in providing a means of connecting families who couldn't afford to purchase brand new children's clothes, furniture and accessories with families who had these items in gently used, but still excellent condition. <br>
<br>
We were a children's consignment &amp; retail store that took Walled Lake, Michigan by storm.  We turned the entire consignment industry on it's ear with innovative new product offerings, and policies and procedures that were unheard of at the time.  We were much sought after for consulting other stores on ways to improve their businesses, and maximize their profits.<br>
<br>
We also designed, developed and implemented several unique software programs to make the business operate more smoothly.<br>
<br>
Our business was booming in 2005 when several personal circumstances happened one right after the other forcing us to close the business with hopes of opening it again at some point in the future.</p>

    <p class="description">Founded in 1994 Innovative Data Services, Inc. (ID-Net) was a leading edge Internet Service Provider for the State of Michigan.  <br>
<br>
As one of the founding ISP's in Michigan we sold Internet &amp; Consulting services to many of Michigan's elite (Chrysler, K-Mart Corporation, Absopure, Plastipak, Akebono, Manpower and Computer Mail Services to name a few).  <br>
<br>
In 2000/2001 much of our infrastructure depended on deals we had with other major carriers and unfortunately much of their (Dot-Com BOOM) demise carried thru to our own company. <br>
<br>
After the dust settled we sold the company to pursue other ventures.</p>

    <p class="description">Tech Point was a company that wrote Point of Sale software for IBM cash registers.  <br>
<br>
Their software was used in many retail stores (Electronics Boutique, The Wiz, etc).  <br>
<br>
They were purchased in 1994 (I believe) by Microbilt (they made the signature capture devices that you would sign your credit card receipts on back in the day).  <br>
<br>
I was a responsible for forecasting projects, splitting up the project into smaller tasks and assigning those tasks to others.  I also wrote the entire system code to process credit card transactions.</p>

    <p class="description">At just 15 years old my mother had the vision that I might be interested in this &quot;Computer Programming&quot; thing.  She took me downtown and (since I was underage) formed my first company for me.  <br>
<br>
Super Soft Software was in the business of writing custom software applications for companies on a contract basis.  <br>
<br>
We wrote a bulletin board system (for West Metro TI-99'ers user group to exchange messages and tips &amp; tricks relating to the TI-994a computer), golf score tracking (to track various golf players and provide a statistical analysis of their games), locker maintenance software (to keep track of the combination lock codes on the lockers in the school system), Limousine software (to track limousine rentals, drivers, paychecks, etc), Accounting software (for tracking consulting &amp; repair jobs) and numerous other projects over the years.</p>

    <p class="description">Merchants Cash Register was a leading Point of Sale company in Michigan for restaurants in the late 80's / early 90's.<br>
<br>
Their cash registers were found in nearly every fast food restaurant in the state.<br>
<br>
Being a leader in the industry, they could foresee that technology was changing and customizable software based POS systems were the future.<br>
<br>
They brought me on as the Lead Programmer in 1991 to write a brand new software package for them.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately was in a car accident and was unable to continue working past early 1992.  I hired a close personal friend of mine (Scott Deming) to continue with the development.  <br>
<br>
The software package went on and was being looked at by several large clients (Little Caesars, and a company in Canada called Pizza-Pizza) before Merchants Cash Registers disappeared (went out of business? Got bought out?)</p>

    <p class="description">Computer Mail Services started it's journey as a company that wrote an interface to the enormously popular (at the time) MCI:Mail.<br>
<br>
I was responsible for providing a UNIX port of the software, and writing a scripting language (that is still used in the companies products today).<br>
<br>
The company was founded by Dan Deward and Lih-tah Wong who hired their first employee Alan to help bring their dreams to reality.<br>
<br>
Dan actually found me while I was working at a local Television Repair Shop in Canton, Michigan (called Ricks T.V. Repair near his home) and had the vision to bring me on board even though I was only 16 years of age.</p>

      <p class="notes">I was self-taught.  We got our first computer when I was 13 years old and I spent day and night writing software in assembly language, basic, and C.  I wrote software for the schools, and taught many of the teachers before dropping out of High-School in 1986.  It was obvious that my knowledge far exceeded anything they were teaching and I sought out alternative places to feed my thirst for knowledge.  I went back in 1989 and received my GED.  I tried college for a year or two around 1990 at Henry Ford Community College but it was the same story.  My knowledge of computers, software development, and networking far (did I mention FAR?) exceeded that of what my teachers knew, let alone what they were teaching...  For years, I ate, drank, and slept by my computer.  I was fascinated by it and what it was capable of, and I'm still that way today.</p>
