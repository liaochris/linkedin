                ===<br>
&#x201c;There is a long way to go until the world is &#x2018;Re:Loved&#x2019; as my personal vision reads &#x2013; meaning a world where you meet your fellow human being with Love and Respect, and you can expect to be met with the same.<br>
<br>
But even a thousand mile journey has to begin with one step, as Lao Tse suggests. Sustainopreneurship is such a step - a strong and powerful one; &#x2018;Business with a Cause&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>
===<br>
<br>
OneLineBio: I am a Sustainopreneurial Facilitator and a Global Knowledge Nomad Networking with Intention and Quality, who runs/develops six ventures; SLICE Services and Publishing, DJ Anders, &#xc6;REAS(i), Club2Club, Ignition Communications and SEEDS Innovation Fund; with a daughter soon two years old, and in a romantic love relationship (after a successful divorce)!<br>
<br>
--<br>
FIRSTLY, I am a Qualitative Intentional Networker. My LinkedIn Trusted Network are those sharing my Intention, Values and Cause Orientation. I only add people I have a relationship history with from elsewhere, and where I safely can recommend them (the core purpose of LinkedIn). I am a &quot;COLIBRI&quot;: Cause-Oriented Linked In Buddy Referring Inter-networker - see http://www.hubpages.com/hub/networking.<br>

    <p class="description">I first got appointed as a lease holder for the business category Business Consulting &gt; Social Enterprise over at Ki-work in July, the virtual work outsourcing platform - revolutionizing online work! On Ki-work you COLLABORATE with people you can trust, COMPETE to win work globally and CONTROL your online business. Beyond that, it was more close to my expertise to actually establish a new business category named Sustainability Entrepreneurship - more niche, more deep. Ki-work in general works as my shopping window for my virtual services delivered through my freelance/consultancy brand SLICE Services and Publishing.<br>

    <p class="description">In May 9th, 2008, the Club Concept and Community Club2Club had the premi&#xe8;re night, with Guest DJ's Manuel le Saux (IT) and Cliff Coenraad (NL). I started the club concept together with Johannes Fredheim (Drifter Design), with some development work initiated February 2008. I am resident DJ together with Fred Acler (SE). The bookings and A&amp;R function is done with advisory Jimmy Persson (Manager, Icon Management). We are currently preparing for the second event, which will be a competition for two open slots for Residency DJ's. Our home venue is the music-oriented and live performance venue Black Horn in Norrk&#xf6;ping.<br>

    <p class="description">With a need to organize and systematize research on sustainopreneurship beyond a list of crucial publishing now defining the concept (on Wikipedia since Oct 17, 2008), and testing its validity, together with outlining the research challenges ahead, I have taken the initiative to form an interim association for enactive research, education and application of sustainopreneurship - in short &#xc6;REAS(i). Private invitations of founding members is now commencing beyond the book chapter published in mid September 2008 outlining the research challenges ahead.<br>

I am responsible for research/branding/networking/business development - in short deep exploration. Together with a deepwide network of mentors/linked resources, a webshop opens when financed. Currently (July 08) we plan an event series in the name of YouFlow, to jointly manifest one corner of the brand Ignition - finding your innermost spirit and transform it into sustainable action with e. g. internet, (personal) branding and networking as leverage for your cause. The surplus finances the business with Sustainability Profile Clothing to empower Sustainopreneurs. I coordinate recruitment of key stakeholders.<br>

The brand name (what is attached beyond the &quot;SEEDS&quot; acronym) has shifted through the years, but the basic idea is the same. SEEDS as an acronym stands for Strengthening of Health, Education, Entrepreneurship, Digital Unification and Sustainable Distributed Energy, and it is the main topic for my pending paper to be presented in India.<br>

<br>
People first, then technology, then financial resources, in that order &#x2013; i. e. micro-finance with a sustainability cause!<br>

Three core concepts:<br>

* Sustainability (Deep/Holistic) <br>
* Innovation<br>
* Entrepreneurship<br>
<br>
I. e. - Sustainopreneurship.<br>
<br>
My first research, defining sustainopreneurship, published through &quot;Science for Sustainable Development&quot;, conference proceedings was published in September 2006.<br>

Instead of multiplying the works associated to the association, it was meant to have replications of good practices to be done, with culturally adapted franchises.<br>

It was intended that the synergy and leverage that came from unifying the existing initiatives should increase the power of the associated processes by coming together and collectively and collaboratively share experiences and energy in a plus-sum game.</p>

This includes to prepare them for what to come when presenting their winning case for the SIFE World Cup in Toronto, this Fall - October 2005. The winning case was Rinkeby Business Lab - to support Young Entrepreneurs in a marginalized immigrant dense Stockholm suburb on the primary school level - where mentors come from Stockholm School of Economics.

    <p class="description">Following an Idea fired up during the Medinge Winter Retreat (chaired by World Brand Expert Chris Macrae in January 2005) with Friends Ed Daniel and Lilly Evans, the DM community went live April, 2005, collecting proactive forces for sustainability. <br>
<br>
E. g. microfinance is one example. It is an application of the concept Sustainability Innovation, where microfinance is an innovation for sustainability, with the sustainability problem it helps solving is poverty - with a list of maybe 15 core sustainability problems, e. g. climate change, illiteracy, health issues like hunger/water/obesity/HIV/AIDS all reinforcing poverty in vicious circles.<br>
<br>
I seized the moderator job in July 2005, and site closed Jan 2006. This virtual community of practice failed to meet its goals, and I take the lessons of this to make it better out with &#xc6;REAS build up. One of the core lessons is that the team operating it should not do it Pro Bono.</p>

    <p class="description">In the last phase of the Research and Development process of the On a Mission Concept, finalized when I ended my chairmanship end of April, 2004, the intense work of launching our first campaign started, and finding both Brand Name and Logo Design. The result one year later is the Sustainablity Profile Clothings brand Ignition&#x2122;, with CEO Rikard Jansson as the coordinator of the Sustainable Brand/Trade build-up.<br>
<br>
I supported him with sustainability branding development.<br>

During this time a number of syncronistically appearing 'Sustainability Innovations' were identified, in what I name the 'R' pt I period in the total R&amp;D process to what is now institutionalized as OAM Uganda/Sweden. The 'Ignition' of the whole process came Jan 5, 2000. The full story is found through my Master Thesis, googling at http://scholar.google.com on 'sustainopreneurship'.</p>

Thus the &quot;registration-only&quot; status of my senior university studies most of the time, until the point where I used the OAM Concept, SEEDS Sustainability Investment Fund, SEEDS Magazine, Club PuLS, DJ Anders, S*E*N*S*A, Ignition&#x2122; and SLICE Brands as eight interlinked case studies for the Master Thesis published May 2007, getting my degree. The Business Plan and the recruitment of our first external client was the last part of the empirical material of the Thesis, preparing for the launch in 2007 now with end of formal studies.<br>
