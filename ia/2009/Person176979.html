    <p class="description">From June 2006 to Present<br>
Lockehaven was designed for both vacationers and business visitors and is ideal for longer stays. For lots more detail, photos and even videos, please visit the Lockehaven website at www.lockehaven.ca. <br>
<br>
Located right on the water in scenic and peaceful Deep Cove at the edge of BC&#x2019;s wilderness in North Vancouver, Lockehaven seems like a remote coastal resort &#x2013; and yet it is only a 25 minute drive from downtown Vancouver. Restaurants, a pub, kayaking and mountain hiking are an easy walk away. The extra-large self-contained one-bedroom suites, expansive outside decks overlooking the water, outside entrances and in-suite kitchenettes offer luxury and privacy. Each suite has an outdoor hot tub - great for relaxing after a hard day of work or play. The in-suite offices have desks, computers, laser printers, wireless Internet and private VOIP phone lines.<br>
<br>
Noulan now just does the marketing. His wife Denise manages the day to day operation of the resort.</p>
