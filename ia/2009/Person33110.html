<br>
I have the privilege of being at home with our 3-year old son, although this happened by the misfortune of the economy.  I was laid off from the ad agency at the tail end of 6/08, and with the suddenness of being a one-income home, daycare expenses became impossible.  Initially, I began a job search, but it was difficult with my wife working such long hours.<br>
<br>
Then, at the beginning of this year, my wife was part of a 56-person lay off at M&amp;I Bank, after 7 exceptional, hard-working years.  That's the bad news.<br>
<br>
The positive spin is the fact that I have taken from every job I have ever had, skills that I need to raise Martin.  I multi-task better, I have  more patience, and I can't EVER quit early; only when the job is done.  I never get a break, except when we alternate responsibilities, so we both have time to work on our job search.  It has had it's rewards, but it has led to hardship.  I'm not too proud to say it.<br>
<br>
I am hungrier than ever to be part of a team again and excel in the manner I always have.  If anyone is reading this; read the rest of my profile, to get an idea of my skill sets.  Then, please give me a call, or shoot me an e-mail.</p>

-Sale and initial design of commercial websites<br>
-Specialized in Search Engine Advertising and Optimization<br>
-Ad copy<br>
-Press releases<br>
<br>
<br>
While contracted with TAP Media, I sold and serviced advertising and marketing media to commercial businesses.  TAP Media equipped me with a full set of productive, value-added advertising medial products to offer clients to increase their client base, exposure and, subsequently, their revenues.<br>
<br>
The majority of my work involved serving clients' website marketing needs.  I concentrated my efforts on Search Engine Advertising through the use of Google AdWords, as well as website optimization.  <br>
<br>
In addition to bringing traffic to the front door of client websites, I also created the initial design and structure, so it was easy to hand off to the programming staff.  In proactively updating content, I added visual appeal through a powerful website enhancement product called Walkout Video, which enables business owners, or the spokesperson of their choice to deliver a video message to their customers.  I wrote copy for numerous :30 second scripts, while simultaneously acquiring and managing the spokesmodel talent.<br>
<br>
My education, writing skills, and business experience were also an asset to the organization, as I assisted President, Mike Schuch Jr., with a variety of projects.  I wrote a press release that precipitated immediate response from a major media player in the Milwaukee market.  I also wrote copy for initial, industry-specific marketing solicitations, which were sent to large, aggregated data bases.</p>

    <p class="description">-Sold and managed large national accounts<br>
-Created entire marketing campaign<br>
-Brought internet, webmail, and a networked system to the business<br>
-Supervised and assisted entire driving staff daily<br>
-Demonstrated meticulous and timely customer service<br>
<br>
R.B. Trucking was the first company that challenged me to utilize all areas of my MBA.  I was not only solely responsible for sales growth, but I was able to put my interests in technology, management, and marketing to use.  I managed the entire day-to-day affairs of the company, while executing a marketing campaign and bringing the firm current with internet and networking capabilities.<br>
<br>
My sales efforts were fruitful, as I obtained large national accounts such as Hormel Foods, US Foodservice, Roundy's/Copps Foods, Patrick Cudahy, and Cargill Meat Solutions.  This helped spread the revenue base and prevented R.B. Trucking from getting all of it's eggs from one basket, in addition to accounting for a great deal of annual sales.<br>
<br>
I was also able to be the hub and go-between between the drivers and the customers, which was the core of the daily operations of the business.  I spoke to each driver several times daily and could communicate, at any time, with the customers to give them an accurate arrival or pickup time.  The close contact I had with everyone was simply not available to the customers from larger trucking firms.  It was our niche and defined the corporate mission.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I was involved in setting and revising rates and fuel surcharges as the economy and  industry landscape changed.</p>

-Case managed delinquent child support cases<br>
-Prepared status reports for Judges and Court Commissioners<br>
-Testified in Family Court when necessary<br>
-Gave reports to State Attorneys to aid in their enforcement efforts<br>
<br>
Working for Kaiser Group was a very multi-faceted job that greatly challenged my ability to wear several hats.  My only regret was that the contract we were working under was awarded to another organization 16 months after I was hired.<br>
<br>
My job involved working for a program that unemployed or underemployed delinquent child support cases were court-ordered to participate in.  As a Case Manager, I would set up a job seeking plan with individuals, based on their ability, skills, and their job seeking knowledge.  I met with everyone weekly and gave them a weekly plan, which they were responsible for completing.  It involved a certain number of employer contacts and applications, as well as requiring them to attend workshops for resume writing, interview skills and the like, depending on where their challenged areas might be.  When they reported back the next week I went over the plan with them to determine whether they were in compliance, or not.  Prior to their next hearing, I was trusted to submit a status report to the court.  This report was crucial in determining what, if any, legal action should be taken on an individual.<br>
<br>
This job was a total diversion on my career path, but it was quite a revelation and life-changing experience for a guy who has always been in commissioned-driven positions where results and success are based on numbers.</p>

-Made presentations and inserviced medical devices regularly<br>
-Worked out of home office: managed time &amp; was trustworthy<br>
<br>
To succeed in this industry, required intelligence.  I was trained in Anatomy and Physiology, technical medical products and medical terminology.  The only way to have any staying power in this field was to be able to combine all of this to effectively communicate, with physicians and nursing staff.  Communication by means of a simple phone conversation, the inservicing of a medical product, or straight sales skill in the purchasing department.  Anyway you slice it, you had to sharp as a tack.<br>
<br>
I was most proud of my accomplishments in this field and was sad to leave when the travel aspect began to interfere with my young family.</p>

-Hit sales goal 23 consecutive months (corporate record)<br>
-Sold local avails on CNN, ESPN, TNT, VH1, MTV &amp; many others<br>
-Filled over 75% of commercial space on 13 networks<br>
<br>
Rutter Communications was the advertising rep firm for Menomonee Falls' Metrovision Cable Television franchise.  The previous Account Executive was discharged for lack of sales, so I was a little nervous about taking the position, but young self confidence and drive won out.<br>
<br>
I joined the local Rotary Club and other community organizations, had meetings with the Metrovision Manager and developed a territory strategy.  From that point, I never looked back.  I left no stone unturned, in terms of networking and canvassing.  It made for a very full schedule of sales calls, which led to presentations, which led to sales.  It was fun sitting at home and watching my efforts be so visible to the whole community.  We were all over cable TV in a very high-profile manner.  Rutter became a household word, and I am proud to have been part of it.<br>
<br>
As previously referenced, I received accolades and recognition for my efforts in the form of Salesperson of the Year, Campaign of the Year, and The Platinum Award.  The company couldn't have been happier with me and I couldn't have been happier with them.  It was a great run!</p>
