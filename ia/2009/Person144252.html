            <h2>Larry Salomon&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am an extremely versatile professional who has a good view of the &#x201c;business of IT&#x201d; along with a rock solid technology foundation. My strong analytical and problem solving skills have made me ideal for tackling new roles, which I have done successfully many times already during my career. Collectively and together with my excellent relationship management skills, I am suitable for several types of positions and will provide value wherever my talents are aimed.<br>
<br>
Additionally, my background gives me relevance in other areas such as business process re-engineering and rudimentary financial analysis, both of which I have done previously.<br>
<br>
Finally, I have the endorsement of several top-tier individuals, a few of whom are listed as references. However, there are many others of similar caliber that are willing to speak on my behalf about my abilities as a professional and my character strengths as an individual.<br>
<br>
My skills include the following:<br>
<br>
- Strategic business development.  I have successfully developed and implemented long term strategic plans by devising short term tactical plans meant to achieve specific objectives within the longer term strategy.<br>
<br>
- Pre-sales account management.  I am intimately familiar with the standard pre-sales processes used by many sales organizations.<br>
<br>
- Post-sales account management.  I have been solely responsible for the relationships with several accounts.  In this capacity, I built &#x201c;relationship equity&#x201d; with the business sponsors at those accounts and used these relationships to uncover new sales opportunities that were transitioned to the appropriate sales team.<br>
<br>
- Process management.  I have direct and indirect experience with various IT processes in application development, support, and operations management.  Coupled with my ITIL v3 certification, I have instant credibility with senior IT management.<br>
<br>
- Communication.  Lastly, my written and verbal communication skills are top-notch as are my presentation skills.

<br>
- Application infrastructure design<br>

  </p>
    <p class="description">In FY09, the Global Financials team achieved 101% quota attainment on sales exceeding USD$20mm.  As a Sales Consultant on this team, I accomplished the following:<br>
<br>
1. Built relationships. Established and fostered Trusted Adviser relationships with senior IT management in 2 accounts (Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley) by building upon my knowledge of their business, my ITIL knowledge, and my deep technical background.<br>
<br>
2. Developed technical account strategy.  Managed the technical aspects of relationships in conjunction with the Global Account Managers.  This included performing technical discovery and opportunity qualification as well as devising the technical aspects of the account strategy and coordinating its execution.<br>
<br>
3. Managed accounts.  Managed post sales relationships by coordinating logistics between the various business contacts at each account and BMC&#x2019;s technical resources.  This ensured that outstanding product and implementation issues were addressed in a timely fashion by BMC&#x2019;s Support and / or Professional Services teams.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I accomplished the following:<br>
<br>
1. Business Development.  Leveraged my relationships at New York Life to acquire a meeting between the BMC Sales Manager covering New York Life and the Economic Buyer there; moderated the meeting; and ensured that the necessary information was extracted so that a USD$1.3mm deal was closed within 5 weeks.<br>
<br>
2. Business Development.  Pursued a USD$1.8mm net-new license deal at GE and successfully transferred it to the appropriate geographical sales team responsible for the account.</p>

 &mdash; <abbr class="dtend" title="2008-05-01">May 2008</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P8M">(8 months)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">In the position of Strategic Practice Lead, I spearheaded the task forces that defined, developed and implemented the processes used by the 30+ consultants worldwide.  Specifically, I accomplished the following:<br>
<br>
1. Developed implementation methodology.  Replacing the informal process used previously, ADOPT was a five phased approach to services delivery that ensured significantly higher consistency and quality as a result due to greater accountability of the consultants.  Over 90% of all bookings, representing USD$9mm in revenue, were implemented using ADOPT.<br>
<br>
2. Reviewed implementations.  As an ancillary responsibility, I reviewed each engagement to ensure conformity with the ADOPT methodology.<br>
<br>
3. Defined formal career path.  Subdivided into five broad categories, each of the seven steps on this path contained several criteria in each category that must be met before advancement was possible.  This established credibility between the consultants and the sales team as well as our clients, since the exact capabilities of each of the consultants were well known based on their title.<br>
<br>
4. Created global education strategy.  Developed a certification program for our clients using completely revamped training materials; online exams that were product-, role- and deployment-specific; and complemented this with the establishment of regional training centers to provide for the education of new staff within our existing customer base.</p>

    <p class="description">In FY06 and FY07, the North Region had a combined quota in excess of USD$20mm and attainment percentages that exceeded 95% both years.  In this role, I reported to the head of the North Region Sales Consultants and accomplished the following:<br>
<br>
1. Increased sales momentum.  Provided demonstrations of pre-built, streamlined business processes developed to illustrate the process of resolving application problems using BMC's AppSight product suite.   Participated in repeated technical discussions with key stakeholders (up to and including C-level executives) at each account.<br>
<br>
2. Executed proofs of concept.  Validated business cases through proofs of concept. This required a thorough understanding of both the application problem resolution processes used by each organization as well as the applications to which they were applied.  In each, I successfully demonstrated quantifiable value that was then used to justify the sale.<br>
<br>
3. Managed accounts.  Ensured that each of my accounts received the maximum value possible from their use of BMC&#x2019;s AppSight product suite.  I eliminated technical challenges that were encountered; provided additional, customized training to supplement the formal training provided by Professional Services; and evaluated organizational challenges that could be overcome through expanded use of the product.<br>
<br>
4. Increased operational efficiency.  Developed custom applications used to greatly streamline the customer-facing activity of the Sales Engineering team.  This also resulted in greater consistency in the execution of these tasks, leading to more repeatable results and ultimately greater degrees of success.</p>

    <p class="description">As an independent IT consultant, I accomplished the following:<br>
<br>
1. Provided architectural expertise for new components that were to be added.  Subsequently, I was frequently called upon to perform functional design, implement the new components, and develop functional verification test scripts for them.  I was consistently in the top 5 (of a team of 40) in terms of percentage completion of the project goals allocated to me as an individual.<br>
<br>
2. Maintained and enhanced existing features.  I inherited a number of components from another team member, and I ensured that they remained in line with business specifications as the latter evolved.<br>
<br>
3. Performed System Verification Testing (SVT).  Just prior to the release of the application to the first beta site in Amsterdam, I was given responsibility for SVT for a number of application components.  During this time, I lead in both the number of tests executed as well as the number of defects filed against the components.<br>
<br>
The application in question was an ASP.NET application with ties to Siebel (for CRM) and JD Edwards (for financial reconciliation) and was critical in ensuring the success of the business as a whole.</p>
