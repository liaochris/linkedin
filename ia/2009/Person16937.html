<br>
The six topics were Create Your Team: Who should you line up before you begin? Protect Your Dream: Contracts, trademarks, copyrights and patents.

Her photos appeared in calendars and on covers of every major equine publication in the U.S. She photographed all horse sports, from rodeo to dressage, and every breed from Miniature Horses to Fresians.

Her stallion pictures, portraits and conformation shots were featured in hundreds of advertisements in breed magazines, but she was best known for her action shots.
