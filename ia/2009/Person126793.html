    <p class="description">Statistics NZ estimates that there are a little over 100,000 nonprofit organisations operating within the country. About only 1% of these have some form of presence on the World Wide Web. The ones that do can&#x2019;t speak much about engaging their stakeholders, constituents and supporters with the communities they serve? They lack a voice. <br>
<br>
My focus these days is communications for nonprofits using Social Media and Web 2.0 as tools. It's a huge sector requiring support from government at this stage of the recession and the kind outlined in PM John Key's policy-driven speech delivered at the Annual Conference of Philanthropy New Zealand last 18th March. <br>
<br>
The relevance of this type of work is rather simple. When valued at a market wage, labour boosts nonprofit institutions' economic contribution to $6.95 billion or 4.9% of NZ's GDP. People who I bump into these days have their doubts about that claim. When I provide them some published material on the subject, it pretty much ends the argument.<br>
<br>
Convergent Digital Solutions' order of business orbits around empowering NGOs in New Zealand with Web 2.0 solutions that work and one that levels the playing field for them. We fashion customised web communication platforms that give nonprofit organisation a persona and voice. In enhances their social capital and strengthens their brand identity. In doing this, we strive to help NGOs project a clearer picture of themselves through a number of touch points on the Web to a much wider range of individuals, groups and organisations - one that strives to position their organisation in the best of terms. It&#x2019;s their channel on the World Wide Web.</p>

    <p class="description">KQ&amp;A is a private communications consulting group enabling NGOs and SMEs to reach their full potentials on the Web. It combines resources with Convergent Digital Solutions as a joint team of specialists utilising digital-based tools and applications fashioned into versatile website-as-platforms that connect to Web 2.0 touch points.<br>
<br>
The relevance of this work and its outcomes are profound. <br>
<br>
First, NGOs reflect the diversity of society itself through their work in a broad array of fields &#x2013; family, community, health, education, poverty alleviation, environment, culture &amp; the arts, etc. They are established and sustained by individuals working collectively in their communities. By empowering citizens and promoting change at the &#x201c;grass roots&#x201d;, NGOs represent and advance the pluralism and diversity that are characteristic of vibrant and successful modern societies such as ours.<br>
<br>
Second, only independent organisations can serve as watchdogs of both government and business. But at the same time, NGOs can build creative and productive partnerships across and among the three sectors &#x2013; partnerships that draw on the unique strengths of each to advance the common good. <br>
<br>
Third, they enable experimentation and social change by taking on challenges that the public and private sectors simply can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t. Civil society organisations are able to take risks that are economically unacceptable to business and politically unacceptable to government. <br>
<br>
In modern societies across the globe, countless innovations pioneered by NGOs have subsequently been adopted as government policy. Numerous models of service delivery that are considered &#x201c;best practice&#x201d; today were devised, tested, and improved over many years of experimentation by NGOs. In addition, NGO advocacy campaigns induce reluctant governments to adopt policy reforms and force improvements in business practices.<br>
<br>
To be able to do all this more effectively and efficiently, communications for NGOs is therefore, vital.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Focused on expanding new business streams starting with redefining this NGO&#x2019;s brand identity and public persona, I developed a web-based communications platform designed to attract support and commitments from major corporate sponsors, grant-making bodies and major donors here and abroad. Most of the work during this period evolved through a major restructuring of its strategic communications programme.<br>
<br>
Communication is a powerful tool. Letters are for writing, people use telephones for talking and everyone watches television for news and entertainment. Now, what's the Web for? For most, it provides a place like we've never seen before &#x2013; access to information, connection to other people, entry into communities, and the ability to broadcast ideas pressed into service for the individual, group or organisation. <br>
<br>
How do people with common interests find each other? How does anyone find anything nowadays online? The simple answer is: word gets around. And on the Net, word gets around fast. The community of discourse is the audience and people are discovering and inventing new ways to find or share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. NGOs need to realise this and start engaging it. This is what I did for Challenge Trust. <br>
<br>
The Web restores the 'banter of the bazaar', a phrase coined in the Cluetrain Manifesto. It tears down power structures and senseless bureaucracies. It puts everyone in touch with everyone. To speak with a human voice, NGOs must learn to share the concerns of their stakeholders, constituencies and communities. This works best when people inside have the fullest contact possible with people on the outside.</p>

    <p class="description">Metro Rail was responsible for the design, construction, equipping, testing, and commissioning of the US$ 1.4-billion MRT-3 Mass Rail Transit System. This included the supply of fully air-conditioned electric rail vehicles, tracks, fare collection equipment, signaling, communications, power distribution, and the furnishing of other necessary equipment, facilities, and spare parts. <br>
<br>
Metro Rail Transit Corporation, the project company of MRT Holdings, was responsible for constructing the necessary civil works for the system including fixed guideways, passenger stations, power substations, the rail vehicle storage depot and maintenance facilities, and other facilities required to make the system fully operational.<br>
<br>
My role was simply to structure a complex multi-currency financial package, road show the project to the Philippine Government and multilateral banks, raise funds amounting to US$ 1.4-billion (in 1997 Dollars, Yen and Pesos), and manage draw-downs, cash flows and overall financial management for a flagship project situated in a major urban area whose population was estimated to be 19,150,000 persons (2007) with a population density of 13,450/km&#xb2; inside a total land area of 1,425 km&#xb2;. In comparative terms, that is roughly 13.5x more than the 1,414,800 people living in the Auckland Region (June 2008 estimate) consisting of four cities (Auckland, North Shore, Waitakere and Manukau) and three districts (Rodney, Papakura and Franklin).<br>

    <p class="description">How do you eat an elephant? In small bites.<br>
<br>
A huge player in the financial management of private funds business losing market share over the years, they were desperately looking to stem the bleeding and regain stature as a rock solid financial services institution in the Asia Pacific region.<br>
<br>
The Board Chairman of this reputable bank couldn&#x2019;t figure out how such an operation could slide from being No. 2 in market share down to 6th place by the time I joined them. He wanted a reasonable explanation and a quick solution to the problem.<br>
<br>
This bank didn't lack financial expertise nor technical know-how. It consistently ranked 1st in providing best performance for managed funds. So why wasn&#x2019;t all that translating to any consistent growth?<br>
<br>
Two months into the job, I filed my report and recommendation: &#x201c;This operation is first-class by world standards but it has one big problem &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t resonate. It&#x2019;s a communication problem and I know how we can fix it.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
So I came up with a communications plan and brand strategy supported by a tri-media marketing campaign focused on saying just one thing: &#x201c;We Handle Your Money Like It's Our Own Baby.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I took charge of an ailing business segment and, over a 3-year period,  transformed it into the powerhouse player it once was (ranked 1st by Wyatt at year-end 1993) and more in line with its status then as the second largest publicly-held universal bank in the Philippines.  <br>
<br>
The Group I managed during the inclusive period consisted of a focused team of 7 officer-level direct reports supported by 36 full-time staff at the Head Office. My span of control also expanded to supervising a matrix of 263 front-line branch profit centres and their corresponding back-office operations support desks located in various city-, regional- and rural-based branch offices. <br>
<br>
Equitable PCIBank was recently acquired and has been merged with another universal bank &#x2013; Banco de Oro.</p>

    <p class="description">Formed 1903 by the merger of Massachusetts Bank with the First National Bank of Boston. At a subsequent date it changed name to Bank of Boston. This firm merged with Bay Bank in 1996 to form BankBoston. In 1999 it merged with Fleet Financial Group and became Fleet Boston. In 2004 Fleet Boston was acquired by Bank of America.<br>
<br>
In this case, what comes around goes around because while completing a Masters in Business Administration degree at the University of San Francisco USA, I took some practical training in bank operations and financial management with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, respectively..<br>
<br>
Much of the time I spent with this Philippine subsidiary of Bank of Boston was to set up and manage a funds management group, private banking and financial advisory operations not existent before the buy-out a medium-sized bank just prior my entry. I was part of newly-formed executive management team. My role was to introduce new financial services, develop operational capabilities and grow the business under my sphere of functional responsibilities.</p>

<br>
The following year the Ford Foundation gave a five-year US$1.2 million grant to an Inter-University Consortium for development of a full-time MBA program, with Harvard University as project grant administrator. The Harvard Advisory Group suggested a merge of the schools, to establish one institution. the Asian Institute of Management or AIM.<br>
