    <p class="description">Working with my team as SCAD&#x2019;s first VP of ONline Learning, history was made by being the first institution to build a comprehensive model for eLearning, focused first on the traditional then distance based students.  By delivering faculty training (including laptops for all faculty), combined with infusing supplemental online information into the pedagogy, the College successfully flipped the education model to a student centered anytime anywhere learning experience.<br>
<br>
My role included building/delivering strategic educational models that repurpose knowledge based content and promote active/project centered learning within eLearning mediums. This included managing curriculum and pedagogical planning processes with training for all faculty and staff. Primary to this were both the eLearning system we built for testing and managing content related to multimedia course work developed by faculty, as well as writing intellectual property and copyright parameters into faculty contracts.</p>
