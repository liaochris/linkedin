              <p class="summary">
                Colleagues,<br>
<br>
Creating works of art has been my strongest passion my entire life. In my professional career, the people that I emulate are Dennis Muren, Mich Chao, Art Gensler, and Andy Serkis. I am a distinguished alumni of THE Ohio State University. Prior to Lucasfilm, Ltd. working in real time, renderable, and architectural end product has built a solid portfolio and demo reel.<br>
<br>
At Lucasfilm, Ltd., I am currently leading the crusade on film game convergence, while coordinating with these three divisions: LucasArts, Lucasfilm Animation, and Industrial Light and Magic. By working with the assets of ALL divisions, I hope to continue to make our Lucasfilm, Ltd. product the unquestionable strongest on the marketplace under the guidance and storytelling of George Lucas. <br>
<br>
This research involves complete analyzing and understanding of both render and real time assets for maximum output and potential, as well as aspects of convergence. Further research is being done in this matter by myself and my core global research and design group. <br>
<br>
I look forward to speaking to other graphics researchers on the subject matter listed above; and I am always open to accepting linkedin invitations from colleagues sharing my passion for great work as relates to computer visualization.
