              <p class="summary">
                I am a very experienced and delivery-focused Project Manager. I have worked in IT for many years at all levels and in many different roles. I have solid early Consultancy experience, followed by a freelance career in which I have worked for many major companies, primarily in Project Management and Project Leading; I also have strong exposure to the &#x201c;hands-on&#x201d; side including Data Analysis and Modeling, Business Analysis, and Development.<br>
I have well-established skills in stakeholder management, communication, requirements gathering, case-building and planning and control. I am committed to early establishment of project scope and objectives, to ensure that everyone involved understands the project aims and rationale. I am strong in the areas of Risk, Issue and Change Management. I am very quality and delivery-focused, and experienced with PRINCE2, and with other methodologies. I have delivered on assignments with clients such as Dell Computer and RBS, so I have shown my ability to get the job done under pressure. I have managed concurrent projects on several occasions.<br>
Personally, I am practical and pragmatic, pro-active, persistent and patient. I am comfortable dealing with people at all levels of the organisation, and value communication highly. I am very experienced in running project meetings at all levels.<br>
I have followed PRINCE2 principles in all my PM assignments, and am PRINCE2-certified. As a full member of the Association for Project Management I also have the Body of Knowledge (PMBoK) in my toolset.<br>
My knowledge and experience qualifies me for Project Assurance and PMO roles also.

This huge project (&#xa3;100 million+) involved the migration of three billing and customer care systems from legacy platforms to the Convergys ICOMS system. My role was to define the matching, transition and merging of data from multiple platforms, and included analysis of processes, business requirements and data, and production of Requirements and Functional Specifications for the data migration.</p>

The system enabvled Equidebt to retain their highest-value client which represented over 60% of their turnover.</p>

I was responsible for identifying, analysing and prioritising late-identified business requirements and changes and working with Application Development to move these &#x201c;on plan&#x201d;, to ensure Day One business needs would be satisfied by the new system. All work was carried out under PRINCE2 standards. Extremely high-pressure environment, as the project had to ensure compliance with the government&#x2019;s CP186 directive &#x2013; fixed-timescale with significant penalties for non-compliance. Significant early successes and continued delivery ensured reduced pressure by contract completion.</p>

My main role was the management of the contract for the two-tier CRM solution (Lagan FrontLine) that WSASP were implementing in Contact Centres across West Sussex.<br>
I worked with the BA team to identify and document key services and customer requests types that would be handled in the county-wide network of Help Points (&#x2018;One Stop Shops&#x2019;). These were based on the ODPM's Pathfinder program (APLAWS) where Categories are implemented in XML.<br>
I also managed the systems integrator (Anite) in delivering the solution to meet those requirements, including the testing of the initial service requests.<br>
My final task was to create the processes and documentation required to ensure that the solution could be handed over to the various councils&#x2019; staff who would run, support and enhance the system. This included the development of change processes and service level and support agreements. These were all completed according to ITIL standards.</p>
