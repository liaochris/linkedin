            <h2>Abdul-Jalil al-Hakim&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Abdul-Jalil has a tremendous wealth of experience in all aspects of business and personal management, contract drafting and negotiations, and performed all arbitrations of salary grievances and contract disputes for all professional sports and entertainment clients with unprecedented legal and historical results. He negotiates and drafts all agreements for all publishing, merchandising and licensing; commercial advertisements and product endorsements; corporate sponsorships and affiliations; motion picture, television, radio and personal appearances; professional personal services contracts; electronic multimedia, literary, publishing, merchandising, licensing, concerts, tours, broadcasting, and video. He was the first African-American in the field and has taught and lectured Entertainment Law for 35 years. Many of the agents and lawyers in the business where instructed, consulted, influenced or inspired by his work....<br>
<br>
         In an unprecedented case in Professional Basketball he negotiated an addendum to the contract and represented the player in a dispute of the contract that was originally negotiated by the players union director. The inherent problems that this situation provided for the National Basketball Association, the Denver Nuggets, and most importantly the Director of the NBA Players Union and the Union itself, were incredible. In mid-season the team breached the contract with a late payment that triggered a clause in the addendum that allowed him to opt out of the contract. The player withheld his services in the middle of the season and the team filed for arbitration. In prevailing in this matter the player received his pay, was declared free of his contract (&#x201c;a Free Agent&#x201d;), and allowed to negotiate a new contract with the team of his choice. Cite Arbitration Decision in the matter of &#x201c;The National Basketball Association (Denver Nuggets) vs. The National Basketball Players Association (Brian Taylor)&#x201d;, Jan. 25, 1978

    <p class="description">Promoted, Marketed and provided Media for Leon Powe's  &quot;Powe Folks&quot; NBA World Champion Basketball Camp.<br>
In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Powe, a second-year, second-round draft pick from Oakland was the Celtics hero. Years earlier, he was his family&#x2019;s hero, as he helped keep his siblings together while they bounced between 26 different homeless shelters in a year during a patch when his mother couldn&#x2019;t afford shelter. It&#x2019;s one of the most touching sports stories in ages, and his emergence as a playoff force only highlights it.  <br>
ABC/ESPN produced a short biography on how Leon overcame tremendous adversity to make it on the Boston Celtics. The night this aired, Powe wowed the international television crowd as he scored 21 points off the bench in less than 15 minutes to spark the Boston Celtics to a 108-102 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers to take a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.The Celtics went on to win the NBA Championship.</p>

Early in 1996, three Republican campaign operatives assisting Boris Yeltsin's reelection..L. A. Times Review<br>
<br>
Jeff Goldblum, Anthony LaPaglia and Liev Schreiber star as a trio of elite American political campaign operatives who were hired in secret to manage Russian President Boris Yeltsin&#x2019;s election campaign in 1996. He's polling at 6 percent with the election a few months away. First, they must get someone's attention; they succeed finally with Yeltsin's daughter, then it's polling, focus groups, messages and spin. Even as Yeltsin's numbers go up, they are unsure who hired them and if Yeltsin's allies have a different plan in mind than victory. When the going gets toughest, they put a spin on our stake: democracy and capitalism must win. They orchestrate the most spectacular political comeback of the twentieth century - as they &#x201c;sold&#x201d; Boris Yeltsin to the Russian public gaining Yeltsin&#x2019;s successful re-election.</p>

    <p class="description">The tactic was their most effective strategy, greatest strength-  uniquely different and vastly superior to anything Russia had ever witnessed. This strategic plan with our expertise well grounded in modern American campaigning got Yeltsin re-elected. This was simply a matter of fact that he was the best the modern world could get compared to the alternative communist and he was fully supported by the U.S.<br>
A State Department memorandum, marked &#x201c;confidential,&#x2019;&#x2019; summarized then President Bill Clinton&#x2019;s meeting with Yeltsin at a summit in Egypt, where Clinton told Yeltsin he &#x201d;wanted to make sure that everything the United States did would have a positive impact and nothing should have a negative impact&#x2019;&#x2019; on Yeltsin&#x2019;s re-election. The memo added the U. S. wanted an upcoming summit with the Russian leader to be successful to &#x201c;reinforce everything that Yeltsin had done.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>

    <p class="description">Prime Minister Chernomyrdin&#x2019;s party was struggling to distance their leader from the unpopularity of the Government he headed, resolved to using western style campaign strategy. &#x201c;Our Home&#x201d; promised economic stability and continuation of the Democratic course of Yeltsin&#x2019;s government. Being Prime Minister gave Chernomyrdin a huge advantage in access to Russian voters, with slick campaign posters, he told AP  &#x201c;we are using American pop music performances to drum up support among Russian youth for his political campaign&#x201d;; the video scenes showed M.C. Hammer performing. Chernomyrdin&#x2019;s travels around Russia in his capacity as Prime Minister, but looked more like the political campaign trail of an American President. <br>
