              <p class="summary">
                Leadership, execution and results. I have a primary interest in bringing new products &amp; companies to market and unleashing their potential and building shareholder value.  <br>
<br>
I have led management teams and sales (P&amp;L) organizations that controlled over $1 Billion in assets and $250 Million in revenues as well as pre-revenue startups in early formation. (And nothing is harder than getting your first dollar of revenue)<br>
<br>
Perhaps best known by people in the know for being one of a vocal handful who believed in the Citrix vision in the early 90's, and that lead me down a road of adventure, hard work, fun and accomplishment. Then there was this time about 5.5 years later when I joined Citrix tohelp launch a new internet business division focused on the promotion of the ASP (Application Service Provision) marketplace. What a ride...<br>
<br>
Much has been accomplished, experienced and further developed thereafter in terms of channel development, worldwide business development, M&amp;A, strategic partnering, IP creation, invention and growth.<br>
<br>
Today, based on the strength and market power of the Millennial consumers (Gen-Y), coupled with the recession and changes in buying behavior, I have launched a lifestyle brands corporation that will serve the Gen-Y marketplace with authentic premium brands in beverage, apparel and merchandise categories.  Millennium Prime has been in development since late 2008 and will launch in to the marketplace in the fall of 2009.  <br>

    <p class="description">TiGi's data-throughput acceleration products, initially developed to meet the high-speed computational requirements of the United States Government, have evolved over the past three years into a full range of accelerator devices and ultra high-speed storage systems. <br>
<br>
In less than 5 months, we achieved full distribution launch, acquisition of over 35 channel partners across NA, revenue creation of over $2 Million, and a live sales pipeline of over $10 Million+. We then executed a full distribution launch in to Northern Europe, Latin America and Asia in February of 2004. <br>
<br>
In less than one year, I brought a complete management team to TiGi, re-poisitioned the company for success, established a new go-to-market strategy and fully executed our launch. The board decided to change the business focus and strategy of the company in Q1 of 2004 due to ties with the Federal Government that were counter to our commercial business focus and I transitioned out of the company on that basis.</p>

I directed the creation of a strong channel in Northern Europe with great success, launched the product in to the United Kingdom to Enterprise and ISV customers, and attracted the interest of many high profile US based strategic partners.  I was recruited to join the company as an executive by the CEO and the investment bank who funded the company (Giza Group) based on their history in working with me. We exited the company with a sale of the IP to a British group of investors.</p>

    <p class="description">Marubeni Corporation of Japan, who has over $105 Billion in annual revenues, spun off over $1.2 Billion in IT &amp; Telecom assets in to a US based corporation, with the hopes to have the assets strategically grown and brought to the Nasdaq public market. My charter was to strategically position the IT &amp; Telecom assets of Vectant as a full service provider of infrastructure and services to allow a US based ISV to provide software services in the form of outsourcing, ASP or e-Commerce services in the Japan market, then Asia, then the world.  As an executive, I was part of a team managing over $250 Million in revenue and over 700 employees based in Japan. I was asked to join a world class executive team made up on executives from AT&amp;T, Xerox, Revlon and Worldpartners through a retained offer from Heidrick &amp; Struggles based on my reputation in the worldwide software service markets. After 9 months with the company, I was offered a promotion to President of US Operations.</p>

    <p class="description">My affiliation with Citrix Systems began in 1992 as one of the first &quot;committed&quot; external partners, continued through the IPO, further continued through 1998 as a partner to the company, and then with direct employment within a new business division called iBusiness. What a wild ride it was....<br>
<br>
iBusiness was a fast and public ride of shareholder value creation, new market growth and unbridled enthusiasm around the world for the ASP (Application Service Provider Marketplace).  In less than one year, we achieved over $5 Million in revenues, worldwide channels and established ourselves as the thought leaders of the future of software services. The term Application Service Provider (ASP) and Citrix became synonymous based on the worldwide efforts and execution of this team.  The job and description cannot be captured in 1000 characters.  You can do the research. Go to google and type &quot;john marchese asp citrix&quot; and read for yourself...</p>

My charter with EPiCON was to position the technology for certain OEM and strategic partners (Citrix) and to drive direct revenues in to large Enterprise accounts directly.  The company executed a $12 Million OEM technology deal with Citrix Systems (for IMS). After becoming confident that we would be best served to sell our IP to a technology buyer versus productizing the product for corporate use, I joined Citrix Systems to launch the iBusiness ASP business initiative. I continued to stay on as a consultant  and advisor  and  later assisted EPiCON to renew its licensing agreement with Citrix for the IMS product for another year. After that time, ongoing discussions with Nortel Networks accelerated and the company was purchased for $275 Million in a successful exit.</p>

We were a prime go-to-market launching pad for new technology and I particularly became well known by Microsoft, Citrix and Intel to represent new products to the marketplace. Then I became friends with Iacobucci, Roberts and Passaro at a little startup in Florida and the rest was history... My personal consulting rates were amongst the highest in the company and I regularly sold and managed over $3 Million in revenue and managed sales teams and technical consultants that generated much more.  All executives in the company, including myself, were compensated on P&amp;L achievement. We exited the company in a sales to InaCom Corporation &amp;  Ikon Office Solutions.</p>

    <p class="description">I founded Marquis Consulting Associates as a LAN integration and software service company.  My primary specialty was Novell Netware LAN, Database, Software development and remote connectivity solutions.  I successfully grew the business to achieve over $1 Million in high margin revenue with low overhead in our first year.  Realizing that I could not organically grow the company quick enough to compete with the likes of Michael Dell, I merged the company in to USConnect and became a principal in a much larger System Integration and Consulting company that could provide access to the largest customers in the world.</p>
