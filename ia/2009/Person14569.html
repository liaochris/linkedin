    <p class="description">MK Illumination is a Manufacturer of festive lighting and decoration; having seventeen European sales offices.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining in May 2008, MK Illumination was purely focus on driving its product portfolio through a fragmented distribution channel. A radical re-think of its sales strategy resulted in a direct sales force being created, and now offering a complete solution to the end user, which encompasses design, implementation and maintenance. <br>
<br>
My remit was to open multiple accounts across Retail, Leisure, Hospitality and Local Government and achieve one million pounds product sales in year one.<br>
<br>
With full autonomy; I would cold call a potential client, nurturing the relationship over many months. The process would lead to an initial meeting and subsequently a brief and budget being provided. Working in conjunction with our Graphic and Operations Department, I would prepare and present our designs and costs to CEO&#x2019;s, Directors and Marketing Managers. <br>
<br>
During my tenure I generated enquiries to the value of three and half million pounds, the most notable and prestigious being London Oxford Street at one million one hundred thousand pounds.</p>

    <p class="description">Working alongside an old colleague, I co-founded Lindsay Electrical Ltd which grew from three personal in 1994 to 38 personal in 1998. Turnover grew from &#xa3;540,000 in 1994 to &#xa3;2.8 million in 1998.<br>

    <p class="description">On leaving the first company I had ever worked for with only two weeks work, the prospect of building my own business from scratch was both exciting and terrifying. My former employers said they would see me in two weeks - which provided me with the additional motivation I needed to be successful.<br>
<br>
I developed new business by visiting building sites in their very early stages.  I leaflet dropped retail outlets and built my business on recommendation.<br>
<br>
My hard work paid off and the bank balance became proof of my success.  Operating costs were minimal and margins were high.  Turnover in 1990 was &#xa3;75k growing to &#xa3;225k in 1994; this was achieved with one apprentice electrician and one sub- contract electrician.</p>

    <p class="description">On leaving school I was fortunate enough to be offered an electrical apprenticeship with one of the most prestigious commercial and industrial contractors in Bradford.  <br>
<br>
For the majority of my apprenticeship I worked on major refurbishments of Morrison Supermarkets.  On the completion of my apprenticeship (three years) I was promoted to Electrician and within months Approved Electrician.<br>
<br>
By the age of 19 I was appointed Foreman Electrician and given my first major project - a &#xa3;750,000 (electrical content of the project) refurbishment of Keighley Morrison&#x2019;s.  I organised the daily tasks of eight electricians and four apprentices, liaising with the company buyer on a daily basis and organising materials for the project.<br>
<br>
During my time here I developed communication skills and respect, both with the client and the engineers working with me.  The experienced gained during this time would prove to be invaluable during the next 20 years.</p>
