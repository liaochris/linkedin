            <h2>Salgood Sam&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Salgood Sam is Max Douglas. An artist for about 20 years I&#x2019;ve worked in many areas of picture making and story telling. <br>
<br>
Started drawing comics; independent B&amp;W books with Calibre, &amp; Horror &amp; Sci-Fi comics at Marvel. As a Designer in Animation, at Nelvana in Toronto, CINE GROUPE Inc in Montreal. I&#x2019;ve also done storyboarding.<br>
<br>
Expanded into Illustration and Design in other areas, and in 2000 started perusing Editorial Illustration work. Some limited success in this, currently on the lookout a Rep.<br>
<br>
Media; Spent about 6 yrs working in FM radio in the early 90&#x2019;s as producer, host &amp; DJ. I&#x2019;ve been on the web since 96 generating graphics and content, &amp; doing light coding. In the music industry I was pt Graphic Designer for Grenadine Records, did poster work for local acts, and carved &amp; painted the sign at legendary Casa del Popolo. I have public art permanently on display at a few Restaurants, including a mural @Dusty&#x2019;s on Park Ave +  Ave Mont-Royal Ouest looming over breakfast eaters.<br>
<br>
Comics remain my 1st love, after my early experience with commercial publishers I&#x2019;ve moved to mostly creator owned material, acting as writer as well as artist as well. I've had about 30 books published, early on with Marvel and DC, and in the last 8 years with Image &amp; IDW.<br>
<br>
My Graphic Novel with Jim Monroe, Therefore Repent! has been a critical and moderate popular success. For 09&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve short stories coming out in anthologies, Popgun 3 and Comic Book Tattoo and more. And last but not least, my Solo project RevolveR in Oct of '09.<br>
<br>
Was fortunate to receive recognition from the Canada Council for the Arts, a grant allowing me to complete a Novel length project. And was honoured to be amongst the first Nominated for a Doug Wright Award in 2005 as Best Emerging Talent. <br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m looking for Illustration work, editorial and some advertising. And have an unsatisfied fetish for book design. Please, do contact me with any questions.

    <p class="description">For over 19 years I've worked as a freelance artist, making my living almost entirely with my pens, pencils and wits. <br>
<br>
At this time i enjoy a verity of illustration work, and I'm always available for commissions for magazines, advertising and privet customers. <br>
<br>
In addition i have some decent Design chops and have worked up Logos, Posters, Web pages and other assorted bits of Graphic Design over the years. I also have a fair bit of experience as a Designer for Animation and enjoy that work quite a bit as well.<br>
<br>
And I manage to spend most of my time drawing, and lately writing my first love, Comics. <br>
<br>
I have done that in a Work for Hire capacity in the past for Marvel, DC and other major companies. And while  I'm picky about the sort of work i take on in comics now, i am available for commissions in that form as well.<br>

I worked with an old roll model, artist and writer Ty Templeton, and drew 4 stories in this Slim Line style comic. One of which i was able to color as well. Very enjoyable job.<br>

For this series I got layouts from Kieron; was fun, freed me from a lot of the heavy thinking at that first stage. I was free to work them, make appropriate changes. It was a very comfortable approach, and having Kieron as sometimes foil to bounce things off of was rewarding.<br>
<br>
For the stylized rendering in this book I used Inda ink &amp; wash predominantly, and developed a method from separating the art for 2 color printing - the book was printed on yellowish paper and in a deep, dried blood like red brown; and black ink. Successfully achieving a very intense moody feel.<br>

    <p class="description">In 2002 i revisited the halls of Marvel comics, and worked on two books in the experimental Muties line, stories about mutants who are not superheros. <br>
<br>
I worked on 48 pages in all and did the painted cover art for the last book. For the first on book one of the series, Muties #1of6 'The Changeling', I did brake downs for illustrator Peter Ferguson who painted the book. There my prime job was to work out the story telling and flow of the pages here. the series was all Scripted by Karl Bollers - http://salgoodsam.com/thumbs.html<br>
<br>
On the last, sixth issue of Muties #6 of 6 'The Patriot Game', I did full art chores. I worked closely with Bernie Mireault again to come up with the color pallet and feel of the book. I also got to do an extensive re-write with the writer on this issue, and remain exceptionally pleased with the issue.<br>

48 page graphic novella<br>
Art by Salgood Sam, <br>
Scripted by Glen Hanson &amp; Allan Neuwirth<br>
<br>
This 48pg trade was my First Graphic Novella. Done entirely with a Brush, the art is an intentional stylistic echo of 40's comic art and the drawing traditions of H.G. Peter's original comic. Bernie Mireault &amp; I worked closely to choose a color palate for this book that captured the saturated colors of early comics, &amp; the first Technicolor films.<br>
<br>
The original script would have called for a book that was several times longer to do justice to, and sadly had to be cut short due to preset page counts. The plot shows some odd brevity as a result, the missing development is missed. But despite that it reads well and I feel this book is an overall successes. Took a little longer to get done due to the delays from the script but it all got done in time in the end.<br>

    <p class="description">I had the pleasure to work with lots of charmin' folks doing very unique looking background art for the TV version of Sam &amp; Max for the 1st season of the series. Directed by Steve Whitehouse [http://www.whitehouseanimationinc.com], i worked directly with the Layout dept, which provided the standard clean layout art for use to ink and finish - and in close contact with the design dept, which acted as our quality control dept on this stage of the art. I was fortunate to have a previous working relationship with the head designer, Goran Delic, who put my name in the hat for the gig.<br>
<br>
I received clean-line layouts and was responsible for heavily rendering them with very stylized heavy brush lines, adding a large amount of additional rendering to the art with textures, feathered shading, and a lot of general ink work.<br>

    <p class="description">This was very early on in my WFH days, after the 2 Night Breeds I was asked on to a new Series - part of the Razorline, a sub imprint consisting of 4 books that were outlined at the concept stage by Clive Barker. <br>
<br>
My book was Saint Sinner, the flag ship title of the line. <br>
<br>
Was very excited, a prestigious gig to get so soon in my carrier. I was not happy with the way things went in the end, but it was a major learning experience for me and I'm proud of much of the art I contributed to the books.<br>

    <p class="description">My First official WFH in mainstream Comics.  I was hired on first to compleat an unfinished issue of Clive Barker&#x2019;s Night Breed, #20 : Circle of Vengence pt3. It was the fastest i ever drew i think, did 19 full size [11x17&quot;] pages of art in 10 days. Amazed me and impressed the editors who a month latter asked if I'd like another. <br>
<br>
That  was 'THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY' in Clive Barker&#x2019;s Night Breed #23, a 32 page story. This one also went fast and i'm still very pleased with a lot of the art i did on it.<br>

      <p class="notes">Largely self taught endlessly active autodidact. Drawing compulsively and making things since I was a child, I attended Wexford CI for 3.5 yrs for their Advanced Arts program. <br>
<br>
Ultimately I have no diplomas, but I come from a family of artists, and have enjoyed the privilege of having many mentors. I've also happily snapped my vintage Nikon F at stuff for over 17yrs, taken repeated and slowly improving stabs at writing, played in B&amp;W dark rooms, cut up collages, produced radio and audio plays, messed with clay, painted paint, and yes, drawn ceaselessly for all my life.<br>
