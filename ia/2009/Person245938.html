    <p class="description">China has the 4th largest economy in the world after US, Japan, &amp; Germany with a nominal GDP of US$3.251 trillion (2007) when measured in exchange-rate terms. It has the world's second largest economy with a GDP of over $7.1 trillion (2007) when measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. China is the fastest growing major economy in the world contributing the most to global growth in 2007. Since free market reforms in 1978 China's GDP has grown an average 9.9 percent a year. China's per capita income has grown at an average annual rate of more than 8% over the last three decades, drastically reducing poverty, but this rapid growth has been accompanied by rising income inequalities.The country's per capita income is classified as in the lower middle category by world standards, at about $2,000 (nominal, 107th of 179 countries/economies), &amp; $7,800 (PPP, 82nd of 179 countries/economies) in 2006, according to the International Monetary Fund.<br>
<br>
Since the late 1970s &amp; early 1980s, the economic reforms initially began with the shift of farming work to a system of household responsibility to start the phase out of collectivized agriculture, and later expanded to include the gradual liberalization in of prices; fiscal decentralization; increased autonomy for state enterprises that increased the authority of local government officials and plant managers in industry thereby permitting a wide variety of private enterprise in services and light manufacturing; the foundation of a diversified banking system; the development of stock markets; the rapid growth of the non-state sector, and the opening of the economy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment. China's foreign trade has grown faster than its GDP for the past 25 years.  China's growth came from the private sector instead of exports. Particularly the smaller public sector, which was dominated by about 200 large state enterprises concentrated mostly in utilities, heavy industries, and energy resources.</p>

    <p class="description">Social Credit governed Alberta from 1935 to 1971. During this time: the Social Credit government eliminated Alberta's debt; established the Credit Union Act and Alberta Treasury Branches to provide low-interest loans; kept Alberta debt-free and income tax-free; and encouraged local ownership and control of hospitals, schools and utilities.<br>
<br>
In British Columbia, Social Credit continued as government, with an election held every 3 years, until 1972. During this time BC Hydro was developed from B.C. Electric, the B.C. Ferry fleet was established, the Universities of Victoria and Simon Fraser and BCIT and regional technical schools and colleges were developed throughout the province. The highway system was expanded and upgraded; Hospital insurance and Medicare became realities; the Columbia River Treaty and the Bennett and Keenlyside Dams were built and the whole province prospered. <br>
<br>
Socreds have been known as the Ralliement des Creditistes in Quebec. Socrial Credit elected as many as 30 M.P.s to the federal House of Commons and had one Senator, Ernst Manning, father of Reform Party Leader Hon. Preston Manning. <br>
<br>
Social Credit ideas have spread from England to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.<br>
<br>
The founder of Social Credit, C.H. Douglas, presented this idea as early as 1917. Keynes actually referred somewhat favorably to Douglas's basic idea in the General Theory. The Social Credit movement still exists in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
