            <h2>Bob Swensen&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have been in the Aviation / Airport Management business since 1983, starting my career at JFK Airport. I have worked through numerous positions with the Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ, learning all aspects airport management. <br>
<br>
I have extensive experience in Airside Ops (FAR 139 requirements, snow removal, and airfield management), Terminal Mgt (check-in ops, common use systems and management, security checkpoint, terminal design, passenger &amp; baggage flow), and Security Ops (TSR 1542 regulatory compliance, ASC role, etc). I enjoyed a 21 year career with the Port Authority. <br>
<br>
Following my public sector career, I spent five (5) years in the private sector with JFKIAT LLC, a private management firm responsible for the successful operation of Terminal 4 at JFK. I gained valuable experience in continuous process improvement, result-based management, performance metrics, managing shared use environments (which are migrating to US Airports), providing excellent customer service, and developed a laser focus on quality. <br>
<br>
I now serve San Jose Int'l Airport for the past 6 years. To date, I have managed the Airside Ops Dept, Terminal Mgt. Section, and the Security Dept. working as the Airport's ASC for over 2 years. <br>
<br>
Presently, I am the Airport's Activation Manager and responsible for coordinating all activities associated with the successful opening and management of new facilities as they are completed. To date, two (2) new check-in lobbies and a new 6 gate terminal concourse were successfully opened, and newly built / renovated areas of an existing terminal, a new consolidated car rental / parking garage, and a new terminal in June 2010 will be activated over the next year.  <br>
<br>
In my future career I strive to become an Asst. Airport Director in the short-term to further expand my airport knowledge and expertise, and a Director thereafter, or enter the private sector once again as a consultant to airports and the aviation professionals.
