            <h2>Dr. Vera Lee Byrd, Educational Consultant&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                When I graduated from Barberton High School, I began my post-secondary education in 1978.  The opportunity to start college as a first-generation, low income, student was made possible by The Higher Education Act of 1965 (and its numerous Reauthorizations).  When former President Lyndon Baines Johnson started the War on Poverty through his Great Society agenda, it was the catalyst for me to earn an undergraduate degree in Sociology (Mount Union College), a graduate degree in College Student Personnel (Bowling Green State University), and a terminal degree in Adult Education (Penn State).  <br>
<br>
After benefitting from various programs that were enacted during President Johnson&#x2019;s administration, I then worked in progressively responsible positions that have given me experience in Act 101, EOP (Educational Opportunity Programs), and TRIO with at-risk students and the general student body.  Because of Act 101, EOP and the TRIO mission, I have been able to work with students from some of the most economically depressed households in the country for the past 23 years.  <br>
<br>
Since 1985, I have worked in four broad programs within adult and higher education, which consisted of Academic Affairs, Community Outreach, Grants, and Student Services.  In doing so, I have coordinated, developed, facilitated, implemented, and planned first year initiatives for new students, returning adult learners, and transfer students.
              </p>
              <h3>Dr. Vera Lee Byrd, Educational Consultant&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
              <p class="skills">
                I have worked in Adult Education, Educational Opportunity Programs, Higher Education, and TRIO, while also working as a part-time Educational Consultant.  As a result, I have adopted the role, mission, and philosophy of the Act 101 Program as my own.  First, it is to provide access to higher education for students who would normally not be eligible for admission to college.  Second, it is to help effectively mainstream students by enhancing their academic skill development.
