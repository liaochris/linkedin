C&amp;O Canal Disaster Recovery<br>
<br>
Worked as part of an interdisciplinary team and the National Park Service to survey, catalog, estimate costs, and track engineering mitigation efforts for thousands of historic sites along the canal in response to flooding. Developed a client server application that stored, processed, and reported on the surveying, engineering, and mitigation efforts for every site, including thousands of high resolution photographs.<br>
<br>
Engineering Tool Integration<br>
<br>
Produced a number of tools that linked various engineering applications together to dramatically improve efficiency.</p>
