<br>
Listed guide for French Minister of Culture<br>
<br>
Because I was lucky enough to spend my childhood in beautiful landscapes (Paris, Normandy, Britanny Michigan), I dedicated the rest of my life to aesthetics. Because family houses were destroyed in June 1944, I oriented part of my professional activity towards historic houses refurbishing. For the same reason, I help other private historic mansions owners in the Scientific Comittee of www.demeure-historique.org magazine.<br>
I started working at 19 for Office Franco Quebecois pour la Jeunesse while graduating from University of Paris (taking night courses). I am currently building a similar night courses scheme for young French Baccalaureat recipients (www.cnam-paysdelaloire.fr).<br>
Because my father used to play/listen to Bach and Chopin music until late, each night, I became a sponsor for young artists, offering them a convenient place (www.orangeries.net) where to record CDs and meet with a public. <br>
<br>
As a listed guide for French Minister of Culture, I focused on interpretation of World Heritage cultural landscapes.<br>
As an official member of Commission R&#xe9;gionale de Protection des Sites et des Paysages for R&#xe9;gion des Pays de la Loire and French Minister of Culture, I participated in the official selection of landscapes and monuments to become listed as &quot;official&quot; Historical Monument.<br>

Creator and manager of the course &quot;Intangible world heritage&quot;: starting from a personal inventory of each student's own intellectual assets, we register these using private and public organizations like Sacem or Soci&#xe9;t&#xe9; des Gens de Lettres. Then we discover how the same inventory can be made for nations and become a basis for Cultural Diversity treaty (Unesco - 2006). Why and how culture can be protected and become a starting point for new business in developping countries.</p>

    <p class="description">With Mijo (spouse) and Marguerite (our youngest daughter) we run a B&amp;B business in Nantes (France). A beautiful swimming pool, a park, an impressive concert room (previously, the castle orangerie), all-comfort suites and &quot;studios&quot; are just some of the reasons why executives from all the world choose to stay in our family-operated residence (www.chateauresidence.com).<br>
<br>
We organize various concerts and art exhibitions, violin master classes and lectures. We love people and consider as a pleasure to have them choosing our 600-years castle as their home for one night to three years (or more!). Some of our guests use bikes to come from Finland, Switzerland or, just, Paris. Others come to write a book. Some record, there, music CDs, taking advantage or our famous Bechstein grand piano in the castle orangerie. Others exhibit paintings, ceramics or sculptures. See and read our guest-book on www.orangeries.org or www.chambredhote.org and www.chateauresidence.com.</p>

    <p class="description">Building consortium(s) for Research &amp; Development projects linked to Unesco and European Commission. My favourite project is about training workers in factories using radio broadcasts. Topics relate to workers social protection. In project &quot;E-tutors&quot;, we help organisations to improve the tutoring process in e-learning programs. Another project (built with Unesco intangible heritage team): how to teach entrepreneurs developping cultural entreprises. I occasionnaly work as an expert for European Commission. To maintain a strong contact with real students, I have been working as an e-tutor in charge of course &quot;Social management&quot; in the curiculum &quot;Ing&#xe9;nieur du Conservatoire National des Arts et M&#xe9;tiers&quot;.

    <p class="description">In 1985, when we decided to create Nantes-Renaissance, Nantes was, already, a renowed city. However, fa&#xe7;ades were grey: smoke had rubbed away the immaculate white of the &quot;tuffeau&quot;. Old people,often lived in nice flats without any comfort. Everybody felt the necessity of a collective reaction. We created Nantes Renaissance as a think-tank for the city policy makers. With the help of Institut Montaigne we invented financial schemes to guarantee to local bankers a market for credits and to flat owners a personal credit at the bank together with a financial help. We obliged owners to buy services from architects; we asked architects to lower their prices in order to be accessible to everyone. We obliged all land owners to restructure, not only the fa&#xe7;ades but also the living places behind them. Since 23 years, all political parties have taken the power at the City Hall. Nantes Renaissance, kept untouched; a recognition for independant social services to our community.</p>

    <p class="description">When we decided to create Protourisme together with Jacques Wintrebert as CEO, we strongly believed in the future of consultancy in the field of Tourism. By that time, consultancy was not widely widspread as it is, to-day, especially, in the world of small independant companies (hotels, restaurants, amusement parks). Our main client, in the beginning, was Parc de Bagatelle, an amusement park near Le Touquet. Then I specialized in market surveys for hotels and ch&#xe2;teaux-hotels. No surprise we decided, later on, to create our own ch&#xe2;teau-residence (see www.chateau-residence.com). After our friend and founder Jacques Wintrebert decided to take a medical break, I became a partner in one of the 5 companies sharing the brand Protourisme. Michel d'Horrer is the manager and main share holder in this company located in Vannes.</p>

    <p class="description">Once upon a time... in a beautiful country called &quot;USA&quot; lived a very wealthy man. He was so wealthy that he owned almost all of the existing Operating Systems installed on Personal Computers, in the world. he decided that all these PCs could be networked through a proprietary network called MSN. By that time, the Internet was only one networking protocol among others. To say it briefly... while I was working as a senior consultant for Cap Gemini I was &quot;hired&quot; as a webmaster for world French-speaking business services by Microsoft Europe (whose headquarters were located in Paris-La Defense). I was in charge of building and moderating forums related to &quot;Business and finances&quot;. These years were exciting but all this ended at Long Beach (California) that special day when &quot;the boss&quot; decided he would refer to the emerging Internet as its new technical reference for MSN.</p>

    <p class="description">To provide access for SMEs to EEC funded Research &amp; Development programs was the mission of APR (Acc&#xe8;s aux programmes de recherche). This small consultancy structure acted as a lobby and a &quot;bureau d'&#xe9;tude&quot; to help SMEs to gain access to Brussels money. One of our first clients was Conservatoire National des Arts et M&#xe9;tiers. Most clients were SMEs from Vend&#xe9;e. They include Energie Syst&#xe8;me (owner: Jean-Louis Gaborit), Groupe Marcel Albert, Horo-Quartz, etc. In that years, SMEs from Vend&#xe9;e were smart enough to sell their know-how and licences to Russia and Poland. But they needed tools to better train over the iron-curtain their buyers and expat'. Thanks to money brought through Comett program we could help our members companies to build distance learning systems. We used video, telephone and early network such as Compuserve to transfer know-how in domains such as clothes manufacturing or sophisticated access control systems.</p>

During almost 15 years I have been lucky enough to work for the well-being of populations of all kinds: citizens (when I worked for politicians like Ren&#xe9; Monory, Minister of Finances, or the Mayor of the City of Nantes), consumers (when I was hired by shopping-centers owners and managers), industrialists, shop owners, bankers, entrepreneurs... When Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) sent me one of their students for an internship, I sent him to USA to build a network of francophiles managers who could be helpful to our region in case USA/France relationships would get bad...or worse! Most impressive study was made for the Mayor of Nantes in 1982: &quot;Why is Nantes a happy town? and why is it so attractive to the rest of France&quot;?</p>

    <p class="description">While a young entrepreneur, many former students came back to me asking if I could help them to build companies where they could achieve their personal dreams without restraining others' dreams... In other words, they (like each of us), wanted to participate in real life competition without feeling oblige to &quot;kill&quot; or hurt anybody. No Chamber of Commerce was interested by this curious type of individuals! This is why, with a group of friends (newsmen, advertisers, legal advisors and militants) we decided to provide free advice to creators of child-care centers, bio-restaurants, etc. Soon, we gathered our strengths with innovators like publisher Henry Dougier (Editions Autrement). We organised a forum in Nantes that was the origin of Garrigue initiative. Then we called our organisations &quot;Boutiques de Gestion&quot;.</p>

After learning System Dynamics from Dr Branch &quot;labor economics&quot; class in Albion College then from University of Paris-IX Dauphine classes, I created this System Dynamics class for the first time in France. Course assignments included MIT Professor Meadows (&quot;Rapport du Club de Rome&quot;). By that time, dedicated software did not exist. All assignments had to be made &quot;by hand&quot;. This means that my students had to parameter systems, including feed-back loops, on paper. Most popular models were dedicated to warming climate change (more than 30 years ago!). I described the paradigm shifts between System Dynamics and the previous methods for predicting future: scenarios methods, prospective, game theory, etc.<br>
It has been an exciting momentum in my teacher career but I fear not much of all this remained engraved in the brains of my students. By the way, even as a teacher, I was the youngest in the class room....</p>

    <p class="description">In XIXth century, &quot;danseurs mondains&quot; were handsome young men. They were hired to invite girls (young and old...) to dance in parties. Their specific role was to prevent any invitee to get bored or to suffer from the humiliation not to be invited. In the last part of the XXth century, modern &quot;danseurs mondains&quot; were hired for the same purpose. Even when dancing was not the main activity in the party. Of course, this role included side-effects and responsibilites of all kinds. In some cases I was asked to protect celebrities and to entertain them. Some of my most beautiful memories include Mrs Pompidou elegance at Opera de Paris (Gala de l'Unicef). I learned a lot while protecting and entertaining some &quot;happy few&quot; beautiful people in Paris of the beginning of the 70s!</p>

Main courses: Kafka, the myth of labyrinth, the myth of Orfeo, &quot;le roman d'initiation&quot;, mythocritics, etc. The theme of my end of term work was &quot;Happyness myths in the work of Pierre Barouh&quot;.During this very special year, it was quite exciting to give some sense to songs I always considered as &quot;guides&quot; in my life.

This teaching was provided by interesting litterature and mythology teachers from University of Angers (including conferences by novelist Michel Tournier).</p>

      <p class="notes">It was a time when winters were so rigorous that we could skate along rivers during hours on Sundays afternoons. It was a time when Mircea Elliade was so eager to make money that he gave conferences at private US colleges to pay for his non conventional carreer as a researcher in the field of religion history. Was it, also, for money? Duke Ellington was one of the entertainers hired by the Dean of Albion College to teach us what jazz was all about. Some of the frienships started there will never end.</p>

			<dt>Activities and Societies:</dt>
			<dd>Albion College was funded in the XIXth century by a Methodist community. It soon became one of the best private colleges in USA. Thanks to a scholarship and a financial help from Mr Gerstacker, CEO of Dow Chemical Company, I could study Speech, Statistics, Labor Economics, Spanish and Religion History (with Mircea Elliade as a teacher). Labor Economics was my main motivation: because i believed in the virtues of social management that was not taught in France.</dd>

      <p class="notes">By that time, boys and girls, left their boarding school once every three months for a one week break. Then we were authorised to visit our family every sunday morning (after mass) and to come back in the afternoon (after &quot;complies&quot;). Some people called it &quot;old good times&quot;... The best souvenir I keep from this period is the series of perfumes created by master perfumer Jean Kerleo (Jean Patou lead perfumer). He re-created the perfect smell of each different walk we did (every sunday or thursday afternoon): walk on the seashore, walk in forests, walk after the rain, etc... He, even, re-created the smell of the cheap perfumes of our first girl-friends...</p>
		<dl class="activities-societies">
			<dt>Activities and Societies:</dt>
			<dd>Scouts de France, boys band and sailing were our main activities. Because we lived in a fishermen village (Carantec), sailing was considered both as a Fine Art and a way of living. Some friends still are sailors on some of the most beautiful yachts in the world. Others are fishermen while others rent boats to the rest of us...</dd>
