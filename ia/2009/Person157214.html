            <h2>Ben Palmer&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                My passion is to help people and businesses improve their current situation.  I have run several businesses and consulted many.  My focuses are in the areas of cost-reduction and running a lean, mean profit machine; as well as the creation, implementation, and successful achievement of a strategic growth plan that makes sense for the business; and how to effectively empower the human resources to take their organizations to the next level. <br>
<br>
My current project (The Cash Coupon) is very exciting to me as I am creating the systems for and teaching people how to improve their financial future.  Many need additional income and I believe that this is the greatest vehicle for them to achieve it.  Getting paid to save money and help others save is a concept that will reach many.  The Cash Coupon is just getting started and already many have been able to make it a successful full-time position.  Those who are helping local small business owners with The Cash Coupon's low-cost, effective, and flexible advertising solution are earning an average wage over $20 per hour.<br>
<br>
On a personal level, I want to help people achieve their maximum potential in order to live a life of great significance.  Signifacance is measured by the impact you make in the lives of others.  I believe that having a foundational faith is the key to this.  Without a guiding hand, people quickly get lost.  Life is a journey; never stop equipping and improving yourself.  Set your goals, develop a plan, and give it your all.  Nothing goes perfectly according to our plans, but if your heart is right and you give it your best effort, the cards will fall into place and you will be a top performer in the game of life.<br>
<br>
I have the heart of a teacher and want to help people find joy in life (no matter what their situation).

    <p class="description">The Cash Coupon is an incredible company that is making a difference in people's lives and the communities where it operates.<br>
<br>
Founder, Rob Bartz, began with the vision to help small business owners with a superior advertising solution.  Print advertising can not lower their prices any further and is outside many small business owner's budgets.  In fact, many sources are or have bankrupted.  Online advertising is the low-cost alternative and very likely the future, but successfully driving results is the challenge.  <br>
<br>
Taking his passion to help people, Rob utilized the home-based business industry - giving people a way to MAKE MONEY by helping drive traffic for the advertisers.  Everyone wins!  The Cash Coupon developed a low-cost, flexible, and highly effective advertising solution and helps people by providing them with a simple and realistic way to earn additional income while saving money and helping others save.  <br>
<br>
This is a brilliant concept and I am proud to be a part of it.  In my position of Director of Member Development, I get to utilize my 10+ years of experience in the industry along with my other experiences to create the systems necessary for Members of The Cash Coupon to succeed.  <br>
<br>
Another one of my trademark phrases that you'll hear me say is &quot;simplification + systemization = duplication = consistency = efficiency = productivity (RESULTS)&quot;.  I work on creating the systems for successful duplication so Members can achieve their goals.  I am also focused on opening new territories (Making a difference one city at a time) and providing the necessary training to develop leaders across the country.<br>
<br>
The Cash Coupon will make a HUGE impact across the nation.  It is providing value, creating opportunity, and giving back.  We also offer a 100% Give-Back Fundraising Program in order to support the kids and local organizations.  I encourage all to support this great company and benefit from the savings as well as the income opportunity.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Combining my experiences in janitorial management and business consulting, I was hired as the Director of Franchise Training and Relations to train the 150+ franchise owners how to run more efficient businesses.  The company had other needs, so I transitioned into a broader role as Director of Development, where my responsibilities expanded to include large account strategic marketing efforts as well as sales where I wrote up just under $1M in new business, re-building  and management of the inside sales department where I achieved the two highest months of production ever recorded in the company's history, as well as my favorite role of simply improving the environment by creating a positive and productive culture.  <br>
<br>
Again, it goes back to the power and rewards for a company creating a culture in which employees willingly give their full effort.  I assure you, it is not money that gets people to give their all.  It is your willingness to hear their ideas and the appreciation you show them.  If an employee knows that you care about them personally, they will give you their all.  I just don't understand how so many companies can remain content or oblivious to only getting minimal effort by their team.  My stay here was short as I felt that The Cash Coupon was where I could make the greatest impact, but I feel that I was able to advance Jani-King of Milwaukee to a better position that will pay them immediate and future dividends.</p>

    <p class="description">An eight week internship and a fantastic experience that allowed me to obtain my licensing for Life, Health/Accident, Property, and Casualty Insurance in the State of Wisconsin as well as learn the Residential and Commercial Insurance Industry.  While closing operations at Boevo, I was not sure of my next move and Jim, Scott, and DJ Rodrian along with their incredible team allowed me to learn from their years of experience.  My time with them gave me the opportunity to see a company that operates with absolute integrity and builds one client at a time by developing a relationship of trust and respect.  I highly recommend their services to people.  Although I loved the field of insurance (as it would have given me a powerful way to help people), it was not where I was meant to be at this time in my life.</p>

    <p class="description">Beginning as a contracted sales organization with a focus in emerging technologies, we evolved to become a powerful development company.  <br>
<br>
We assisted clients with IT support services, web design and development, as well as video production and other marketing and IT services which funded our developmental projects.  We identified market weaknesses and developed low-cost to manage and maintain, efficient, customizable, and cutting-edge technological solutions that gave our clients the edge.  From customer relationship management software to bandwidth aggregation systems to IP communication platforms.  The custom software market is a high risk, high rewards environment and even with some great successes, we decided not to continue.  Some very big players were moving too quickly on us and the stakes were getting to large for my comfort zone.  After coming off of some great successes, this venture taught me a great deal.  You can't win them all.  <br>
<br>
I choose to and encourage others to live a life of great action and adventure.  I often say that I would rather be on the field and lose than in the stands.  Live life to the MAX!!!  <br>
<br>
I owe a significant amount of credit for the achievements we did have with Boevo to having such a talented and dedicated team.  Thank you for your efforts and believing in me.</p>

    <p class="description">MMI gave me yet another opportunity to put my ambition to the test.  I joined the company as I was finishing my last two months of my bachelor degree.  Starting as their Accounts Manager, I maintained and enhanced client relationships through professional and reliable communication and beyond-expected service.  Proving myself as a reliable asset to the company, I was given the task of business development.  With a sincere and honest selling approach and a lot of hard work, we grew 700% in a three year period.  We primarily covered the Midwest, but I was able to open the Southeast by starting in Atlanta with $1.8M in annual customer billings.  Every challenge in life gives us an opportunity to grow and I was entrusted with a great deal of responsibility.  I also maintained nearly all operations aspects of the company with my team of 10 direct reports and several hundred indirectly.  I learned a very valuable lesson in proper selling by also having the responsibility to manage operations.  It's easy to tell people what they want to hear, but tell them the truth and earn their trust and respect which pays dividends in the end.  Never oversell!  With operations throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, my long work days and extensive travel became more than I wanted.  It was time for my next adventure.  <br>
<br>
As a side note, I see too many people that go to work for the paycheck.  They have no heart in what they do.  People, you have one life to live, decide what you love, and do it.  Life is way too precious to waste it and the world needs you to make your contribution.  Become a master of your material.  Believe me, money will be there, but more importantly, you will be fulfilled in your work.  Money is not that important in the big picture.    <br>

Also, under the umbrella of MMI, I managed the investment of two Subway restaurant franchises as the owner was interested in learning the quick service food industry.</p>

    <p class="description">I always kept a full schedule and worked very hard.  I served tables, tended bar, and even worked in a recycling factory as the owner recruited me (nearly all my jobs found me).  One of my favorite jobs was with The Executive Committee, &quot;Chief Executives Working Together&quot;.  I worked as an assistant to Michele Bernstein, their Director of Marketing and a great woman.  Michele bought me my first official business cards (Benefit Consulting).  My experience at TEC gave me the desire to use my passion to help people by moving into teaching, professional speaking, coaching, and consulting (of course in addition to my investments into business ventures).<br>
<br>
I founded Benefit Consulting to help people find a vehicle to achieve their financial goals.  It was &quot;Making Dreams Reality&quot; and &quot;Some people dream of success, while others work hard at it&quot;.  At 18, I was drawn to the industry of network marketing, direct sales, and home businesses.  I was the kid that was going to make millions and traveled the country meeting the best of the best and learning from them.  I had tremendous success, unfortunately my team was not seeing the same results.  So with a heart to help people and not just make money, I stepped back to study the industry as a whole.  What made some successful when others failed?  I learned it was not the companies fault, but rather people not aligning with the right company or getting started with an improper understanding of what they needed to do.  Sure people need to find a solid company, powerful compensation plan, and have the right training and marketing tools.  But, more importantly, they need to find a product that they believe in and then do the work (input = output).  There is no get rich quick.  To be successful in business one must successfully move a product or provide a service.  For 10 years, I have remained close, but outside the industry as I wanted to earn the respect of being successful in traditional business thus that is where I focused.</p>

    <p class="description">I have always been entrepreneurial in my thinking.  From ages 7-11, I would go to school with my pockets stuffed with &quot;inventory&quot; (candy and school supplies) and sell them for incredible profits.  I would also mow lawns, baby and pet sit, shovel snow, rake leaves, clean houses, wash and wax vehicles, paper routes, etc.  I was always finding ways to make a buck.  I also learned the power of leverage early.  I decided if I mow one lawn myself, I can earn $10.  But, if I get 4 projects and hire my buddies to do the work; then I just take my cut for selling and managing the project.  I am a great worker, but I learned that I enjoyed and was good at being the boss.<br>
<br>
At 12, I started working at the local country club as a caddy.  I worked their in different compacities (caddy, bagroom attendant, server, bartender, bar and grill supervisor) until I was 19.  The experience of surrounding myself with the most elite businessmen taught me that being a successful person in business was a powerful way to be able to make a significant impact.<br>
<br>
During high school, I was involved in several sports (Baseball, Football, Rugby, Wrestling).  I even let my wife convince me to cheerlead with her for a year.  She'll tell you that I did it so the other guys wouldn't try to make their move.  Well, you protect what is good and to be honest it was a great time.  Even with a very busy schedule, I found time to EARN a paycheck.  I worked as a lot attendant at a local car dealership, a waitor at two different restaurants, and established a caddy program at another golf club.  <br>
<br>
I was also very involved in just about every business program and by the time I graduated, I had over 100 business plans in my someday folder.  I view an entrepreneur as someone who sees ways things can improve and is willing to take the risks to make it happen.</p>

      <p class="notes">I am a huge believer in properly equipping yourself for the future.  Beyond increasing my skill and knowledge (thus ability), I wanted to earn my masters degree to qualify me should I ever decide to use my passion to help people in a formal adult education environment.  I chose Organizational Management over the MBA because of its focus on leading and managing the human aspect of an organization.  I am logical thinker, so I do well in operational and business management roles, but my passion is working with and empowering people.<br>
