    <p class="description">Key skills: Remediation of all Lloyds Applications, User Access Control, Process Documentation, VB Scripting.<br>
I am currently working within a large team of contractors to remediate internal and external audit issues around logical access controls, for over 300+ applications. I have been working with the business, SME&#x2019;s, technical units and application data owners to identify, plan, process, and execute validation and certification of their IT applications. This work has included defining the best practice to use and project plan for completing manual remediation. I wrote all the code and tools used to distribute information to line managers, regarding their user&#x2019;s application access and then tracking/processing all replies. I have worked on defining the standard procedures around segregation of duties and toxic combinations within applications. My role has also included the setup, training and organisation of a 3 person BAU team, to carry on our work once our project is completed. I am working closely with various business units, including Security, Risk and HR, to establish new processes and framework for maintaining the tools we have created and developed. Finally, my colleague and I have resolved an ongoing issue within Lloyds, regarding their HR Contractor information, using complex code and implementing a custom written tool. This work we have done is now recognised as a standard across the bank and used by over 15 different business units on a daily basis.</p>

    <p class="description">Key skills: VB Scripting, Security Process implementation, working with the business, Soc-Gen issues.<br>
I worked on a Soc-Gen project, doing some business analyst style work with the business and VB script development. This primarily involved monitoring of: employee; joiner; mover and leaver processes, application access controls and permissioning; file share access and role based access controls. Additionally, we ensured high privilege accounts are managed via the emergency account management process. This is across all platforms including AD, UNIX, Databases and Bank Applications. I also worked on developing many different VB tools within excel, to help with the work being done as part of BAU, including writing a fully customisable program for sending bulk emails in excel, via lotus notes. Other tools including AD queries to display user/group information within excel, to help with analyses in the reports we send. Whilst working for ABN/RBS I have looked into other general security issues, outside of my required scope. This included doing a full AD review of unused user accounts; this resulted in 2500 accounts being deleted &#x2013; 35% of the companies total user base. This had a very large, positive impact on the team, from the business, due to cost saving and also making the structure more secure.</p>

    <p class="description">Fidelity India (Chennai and Delhi Office)  <br>
Key skills: Team management and initial setup; all aspects of IT security as per my daily role in the UK.<br>
I was chosen out of all the UK staff who applied, to travel to India for 6 weeks, on a teaching and training program of our new staff located in Delhi and Chennai. This was another good chance (since my previous trip whilst employed by IBM) for me to gain experience and improve on my teaching skills but also focus more on my management skills. My responsibilities included assigning new staff their new regular roles within the company. This proved to be a challenge for me, as I had to start from a basic level, building in complexity through the various roles and responsibilities until I was able to make a decision on which staff members would be best suited to each of the roles that were required to be filled. Once I was happy that each role was filled with the most suitable member of staff, I went about teaching in greater detail how assigned tasks and roles should be completed on an individual level, until satisfactory competence and confidence had been achieved.</p>

Key skills &#x2013; AS400s teaching, Health Checking training, Exam and technical manual writing.<br>
I was chosen to go to Bangalore, India, for a month to work for IBM, training and teaching their new staff to take over the UK&#x2019;s security health checking. This trip was a fantastic experience and a great chance for me to improve my teaching, management and &#x201c;people&#x201d; skills. I taught a 4 person team over the month I was there, as part of a larger 32 person team; doing 8-11 hour days and most weekends, to make sure the job got done. I was responsible for writing my own training manuals/plans and I ran all my own lessons, presentations and tests, as I saw fit. The whole month was a huge success, both the team and I were extremely confident about the job they had to do when I departed. I received a lot of positive feedback from the work I did, especially considering the age gap (21 at the time), between me, the teacher, and my far older students.</p>

    <p class="description">Key skills &#x2013; AS400 &amp; generic health checking, client visits, Security Consolation, Documentation, Lotus products<br>
I was the first person of a 40+ team which was set up to do &#x2018;health checking&#x2019; for IBM&#x2019;s internal and external accounts. Health-checking is the process of reviewing and verifying security settings against an agreed security document (ISO 9000). When I joined the team I was given 3-4 months training, based in Portsmouth, since then I worked with minimum supervision and with responsibility on various accounts, both internal and external to IBM. I was the UK&#x2019;s specialist for AS/400 health checking, which involves certifying machines meet all aspects of global security standards and then consulting with the business on any changes that need to be made and the impacts this would have on the system, compared to it&#x2019;s benefits. I was involved in the training of other staff members as they joined our team in various locations across the UK. I worked on several major projects in the team, including the roll out of new health checking tools and taking on the health checking of a new, large, customer account. As I worked on external customer accounts I had to provide our customers with security advice, depending on their situation, as well as maintaining a very high quality and standard of presentation in the work/reports presented to them and during client visits. I worked on flex-time but I was involved in very early starts and late finishes, to get projects completed. Finally, I travelled across the UK to perform health checks at customer sites, which involved organising my own travel arrangements and meeting face-to-face with customers to complete the work and then advise and recommend after the job was finished, depending on their specific needs and security policies.</p>
