    <h2>Nathaniel Payne&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        I am a developing marketing, strategy, and leadership expert with over 8 years of recruiting, coaching, and people management experience. I believe in the power of learning and education, and for 3 years I was a top ranked teaching and at Simon Fraser University in the areas of organizational strategy, finance, accounting, and consumer behaviour, teaching numerous lectures and tutorials in the faculty of business. I have also researched and been published in the Faculty of Education.<br>
<br>
Additionally, through my various positions as an investor relations and marketing associate, analyst, researcher, and consultant I have analyzed the financial statements, financial structures, marketing strategy, and business operations of numerous  businesses in the consumer products, mining, investment, and real estate domains, and was the assistant manager of Future Shop's $400 million laptop business in Canada. In 2003 wrote a manual on financial analysis, and have been involved training and teaching numerous managers and students in a variety of areas. <br>
<br>
I have a passion for writing and editing, and love teaching. My goal is to complete graduate work in the Faculty of Business at Simon Fraser University (MBA) &amp; PhD (UBC), build an international publishing company, while becoming a key part of SFU's educational strategy team and a leading researcher, teacher, and consultant in the areas of consumer behaviour, strategic marketing management and innovation.  <br>
<br>
Finally, and most importantly, I believe in giving and changing the world through action and inspiring growth. My goal is to one day become one of the greatest corporate philanthropists and leaders of this century, and to change the world by investing in education, health, rural and sustainable development, and the environment. In my spare time I pursue one of my greatest passions - writing both books &amp; screenplays - and aspire to be one of the greatest literary contributors, authors, and storytellers of the 21st century.
