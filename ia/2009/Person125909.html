With homes from $150,000 to $190,000, new homeowners will enjoy the same great quality as those in The Lake of Louisburg while also getting floorplans developed for their budget.  As the suburb that has great proximity to Johnson County and Kansas City business, Louisburg remains the &quot;new frontier&quot; for home buyers looking for maximum value for their dollar.
