                I describe myself as a person who is providing an improved patient care every day through a passion to develop, manufacture and continually improve biomedical devices to save, enhance and prolong human lives&#x2026;.<br>
<br>
I preferred making my LinkedIn profile not an exact copy of my resume rather would like to create it as a series of stories of my professional life and related experiences. These experiences and stories are only supplements to my resume and will help the readers to know more about myself than to know about my &#x2018;leadership &amp; technical skills&#x2019;, a job that I prefer to leave with my resume&#x2026;.<br>
<br>
With LinkedIn&#x2019;s limited allowances of words, 2000 characters in most fields, I know my stories will be short, will lose the natural continuity and will be disrupted suddenly, but hey! I am not writing a book here. If noticed, LinkedIn administrator would probably say&#x2026;please see a publisher for your need&#x2026; <br>
<br>
One last thing [before you get impatient or bored], for the convenience of the readers I've put a sequential note [1], [2],&#x2026;etc. at the start of each section. Reading the content in this sequence will help to read the stories in a chronological order&#x2026;...enjoy...

    <p class="description">[7] Throughout my entire visa crisis, GM management supported me all the way they could. I had a status of Canadian landed immigrant since 1999 and therefore once returned to US, I decided to move there to complete my residency and become a Canadian citizen so that my travel to US becomes less painful later. GM Oshawa stamping plant needed the lead problem solver (same position that I held at Indy) at that time and my upper management made my move happen (I&#x2019;m sure they twisted some arms). As a much smaller plant than Indy&#x2019;s, I knew Oshawa stamping wouldn&#x2019;t offer me much learning or growing opportunity but at least it allowed me to continue expanding my network in GM and promoted me to a Senior Quality Engineer. In early 2005, after becoming a Canadian citizen (by singing O! Canada! with a group of new citizens), I started looking for opportunities back again within GM in the US. But unfortunately that was not a good time for GM or any other US automakers&#x2026;organizations were being downsized, plants were being closed&#x2026;Suddenly I got an interview call one day from a healthcare product manufacturer in Cleveland, OH and went there to explore&#x2026;I took the opportunity to ask questions and found out a world outside &#x2018;automotive&#x2019;! Once returned to home, I logged into Yahoo Finance and downloaded all employers&#x2019; names by &#x2018;Healthcare and Biotechnology&#x2019; and surely Boston Scientific showed up as one of the top employers with others. I refreshed my resume on Monster and started applying for jobs in biotechnology everyday &#x2026; After 8 beautiful years with General Motors, I turned in a resignation letter on October 26, 2005, left the company on November 9th and joined Boston Scientific on November 15th. Surprisingly just 6 days after that on November 21st, GM announced that it would shut down a total of nine North American plants by 2008 including a big operation in Oshawa! My new colleagues jokingly asked whether I had seen any writing on the bathroom walls in GM. I smiled and said no.</p>

    <p class="description">[6] As I look back today, I can clearly see that Indianapolis was the place where I first started learning and expanding my leadership skill. As a HQ employee resident at a local plant, I knew from the day one that I had to &#x2018;impress&#x2019; the local plant management either by outstanding technical skills or by superb communication or purely by &#x2018;magic&#x2019; to get help from them and be successful at my job and not be considered as a trouble making &#x2018;outsider&#x2019;. Obviously &#x2018;magic&#x2019; was not my forte and therefore I turned to the other two tools for success. Also luckily I was able to find the best plant manager (I have ever seen anywhere) in office at that time. With support from top management, I started engaging the plant in metrics driven Red-X projects, mainly driven by scrap and repair cost numbers. As the plant lead problem solver, I had to give a daily voicemail update to the HQ, present projects during a weekly video conference with HQ and all other stamping plants (followed by an intimidating Q&amp;A session, specially from the HQ statistical masters), mentor brand new plant problem solvers and drag those mentees to the weekly video conference to present their projects (I&#x2019;m sure even today they are cursing me for doing that), sit separately on one-on-one&#x2019;s with the plant manager and the asst. plant manager every month to provide a status update on the top-5 projects&#x2026;in few months, Indianapolis stamping gained its reputation at HQ as a Red-X friendly plant and finally the Red-X support team at HQ found they wouldn&#x2019;t need to travel to Indy every week to promote the program and left it with me.<br>
<br>
Then came a moment of crisis. As a temporary US resident, every time I travelled back to Bangladesh I always had to renew my visa to return. In June 2002, just after I got married there, the local US consular office kept me waiting on background verification before they could issue me a visa (a post 911 trauma). I returned to US after 6 months and decided to give up my temporary status.</p>

    <p class="description">[5] MFD started forming its statistical engineering group by hiring one dedicated problem solver at each stamping plant and a group of &#x2018;already trained and certified&#x2019; Red-X problem solvers at its HQ, all reporting to the same engineering manager at the HQ. Engineers at HQ would travel to the plants every week and coach the plant problem solvers until the plant engineers would be certified up to a level that they could start leading and coaching other plant engineers. I started travelling to Pontiac, MI; Lansing, MI; Mansfield, OH and Pittsburg, PA stamping plants; leading and coaching engineers on projects at those facilities. Similar to SixSigma GreenBelt, BlackBelt and Master BlackBelt certifications; Red-X had Apprentice, Journeyman and Master certifications. As a Red-X Journeyman, I needed to coach two other fresh problem solvers to Journeyman and to complete a total of 9 projects to receive my Red-X Master certification. I started working on multiple projects at those facilities with different team members and solving problems like Chevy Tahoe&#x2019;s lift gate twist, Buick LeSabre&#x2019;s wheel house panel split, Chevy S-10&#x2019;s radiator support weld crack  and many more. Although the rigorous travelling was wearing and tearing me out, the projects were pure fun. As time progressed, some problem solvers at different plants were either dropping off or were not making any progress at all, either because of lack of interest or skill or because of lack of being able to create partnership with the local plant management. Indianapolis stamping plant was one of the worst sufferers. I was offered the opportunity to move to Indianapolis and become the resident plant problem solver. After continuous travelling for past few years, I decided it would be the best to settle in a plant and focus on further developing technical and leadership skills. After living in the greater Detroit for almost 5 years, I finally moved out to Indianapolis with a complete relocation help from GM.</p>

    <p class="description">[4] With approx 30% US market share, GM was an &#x2018;auto king&#x2019; at that time and thus money was not a problem. Once formed, half of my team (including myself) started travelling every week to the GM assembly plant in Oklahoma City and the other half to the GM assembly plant in Lordstown, OH to learn the Red-X problem solving tools from Shainin Consultants who were running work shops at those facilities. Soon, each of us started owning and leading projects at those facilities, solving the plants&#x2019; top manufacturing problems uncovered by J.D. Power surveys, warranty claims and various customer surveys - problems ranging from door water leak to instrument panel rattle to engine vibration. We continued that for six months until the small car group merged with other car groups and became the single GM North American Car Group, moving its HQ to the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan; a sign that GM was restructuring to stop its market share decline. Our group&#x2019;s focus also changed from full-time problem solving to being a liaison between the Car Group and the Metal Fabricating Division (owner of 14+ stamping plants). My new responsibilities became coaching stamping plants on problem solving, preparing them for ISO certification and helping them to comply with car group's quality system specially in segregating non-conforming parts. <br>
In early 1999, Metal Fabricating Division (MFD) started forming its own group of Red-X problem solvers (called Statistical Engineers) and started hiring already trained people from the car group as GM permanent employees. I was interviewed and offered a position and the opportunity of becoming a GM permanent employee seemed lucrative at that time, most likely due to the brand image of GM in Detroit and its beautiful 72 storied Renaissance tower (world HQ) reflecting on the Detroit river. I left the North American Car Group for the Metal Fabricating Division and moved out of the technical center at Warren to the MFD HQ in Troy, Michigan.</p>

      <p class="notes">[2] As I started my graduate studies, I felt that the real engineering experience to gain was in the actual workplace not in the classrooms or laboratories. I took a fast approach to finish my graduate studies and decided to replace a long-haul thesis option (more suitable for a Ph.D. entering student) with more course works.<br>
During the summer of 1997 (just past two academic semesters) I started visiting Wayne State&#x2019;s career placement office to learn resume writing, to develop job searching and interview skills while was attending various job fairs to learn more about employers in the US job market. I was able to land couple of on-campus interviews although without any success of being hired. Nevertheless, those interviews prepared me for bigger interviews later.</p>

I was hired as a contract employee with twelve other fresh graduates and thereby started my professional voyage.</dd>

      <p class="notes">[1] As a student of mechanical engineering in Bangladesh, while I was only about to finish my first academic year, I developed an early interest in higher studies in the United States and started visiting the local United States Information Services library, a wing of US Department of States at that time, to learn about US graduate schools. During my final academic year, I kept applying to multiple US graduate schools for admissions with possible graduate assistantships from the schools. With a 97th percentile GRE (Graduate Record Examination) score and a top 3% academic score in the class, I was able to get admitted at Wayne State University in Detroit with a graduate assistantship. Being the mechanical engineering hub (world&#x2019;s motor capital), Detroit also offered me vast professional opportunities and as a result, a month after finishing my undergraduate degree, I boarded the plane and landed in Detroit on Aug 20th, 1996 as a fresh international graduate student for Fall 1996.</p>
