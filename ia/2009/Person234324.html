              <p class="summary">
                I believe the most important factor in selecting the right therapist is experiencing a good fit. I prefer to take the time during the initial phone consultation to give my patients the opportunity to discuss who they are, what they want and how I can help.<br>
<br>
I specialize in psychotherapy with children, adolescents and adults. My patients feel that their needs are met by a caring, knowledgeable and experienced professional. <br>
<br>
Sessions can be provided once a week, twice a month, or as needed. Some issues can be resolved in just a short period of time while others require a longer commitment. Phone sessions can be scheduled as well as communication via email.

    <p class="description">The Day Treatment Program at FSA was at Don Timoteo School in<br>
San Rafael.  It was a combined effort with therapeutic staff from Family Service Agency and Educational Staff from the Marin County Office Of Education.  We worked with severely emotionally disturbed latency age boys and their families.  <br>
<br>
In May of 1989 I was licensed by the state of California to practice psychotherapy.  I continued working for Family Service Agency in both positions, Day Treatment &amp; General Counseling, until November of 1989 when I went on maternity leave prior to opening my own psychotherapy practice in Novato.<br>

  </p>
    <p class="description">In May of 1989 I was licensed by the state of California to indepently  practice psychotherapy. I continued seeing patients in FSA's Novato Office where in 1986,  I had begun working as an Intern.<br>
<br>
Many of my patients were children and adolescents.  I treated<br>
children and adults recovering from traumatic experiences as well as working with patients in recovery from drug and alcohol abuse.  Many of my adult patients were survivors of childhood trauma.  Childhood Trauma became an area in which I specialized when I first opened my own office. <br>
<br>
In November of 1989, I left Family Service Agency and went on maternity leave.   In January of 1990 I opened my private practice in Novato. I worked part time and shared an office space with a fellow therapist whom I met while at Family Service Agency.  <br>
<br>
Jay Skelton, PhD has been my colleague for twenty two years. We initially met when he was hired by FSA to work in their general counseling program.  Dr. Skelton all ready had extensive experience treating severely emotionally disturbed adolescents.  He became both a coleague and a mentor in my work with children and adolescents.  <br>
<br>
For the past nineteen years I have worked full time as a psychotherapist in private practice in Novato seeing children, adults, adolescents and couples.  Working for Family Service Agency enriched my life both by providing me with extensive training and opportunities to treat patents, as well as, making and maintaining relationships with colleagues that have lasted more than twenty years.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">I was a Registered Psychotherapy Intern from September 1986 through May 1989 with Family Service Agency of Marin. I worked in two programs: The General Counseling Program and The Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Program. <br>
<br>
In the General Counseling Program I was supervised by Syndey Bortel, LCSW.  I worked with a large group of therapists. Some, like myself, just starting out and others, having practiced in the field for many years.  <br>
<br>
I was given opportunities to work with children, adults, adolescents and couples. Referrals ranged from problems with communication, to childhood trauma, to anxiety and depression, to alcohol &amp; substance use disorders.  <br>
<br>
I set up two treatment rooms, one in the San Rafael Office and one in the Novato Office. Both were equipped with objects for Sandplay and Play Therapy.  It was clear to me at that time that I wanted to work in more than one modality and Sandplay provided a nonverbal experience that could reach some of the most severely traumatized individuals.<br>
<br>
My training in Sandplay began with Kate Amatruda, MFT and Evalyn T. Dundas.  Many people readily responded to it's ability to provide a safe container in which to experience difficult thoughts an feelings.  It is a rich and rewarding practice that allows clients to speak through symbols and symbolic experience.  It is especially useful with children who need to approach painful experiences indirectly in order to assimilate them with becoming overwhelmed.  <br>
<br>
In the Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Program, I was able to work with children and adults in both group and individual therapy.  I was in individual supervision with Toni Marie Lehman, MFT and in group supervision with Michael Grogan, PhD.Their committment to training and developing highly skilled, caring professionals was outstanding. The Staff at CSAPT developed an intern program that  provided extensive training and experience working with child and adult survivors of sexual abuse.</p>
