    <p class="description">Head of Engineering for the Mott MacDonald / Transnet alliance on the feasibility stage of the South African RichCor Coal Line, to take the capacity of the line from 71MTPA to 81MTPA, the anticipated project value being the equivalent of approximately &#xa3;7bn.  Managing an engineering team of all rail disciplines, and additionally operational planning engineers, the scope was to take the capacity increase requirements and develop over 100 schemes to a single option.  An estimate and construction programme was also developed, ending in the production of a report with back up appendices including the single option designs and associated specifications.  The programme was extremely demanding ending in August.  The Outline design stage then commenced, but was put on hold due to the SA government not being able to fund the expansion due to the credit crunch, at an afternoon&#x2019;s notice.</p>

    <p class="description">Following the award of Rugby Station remodelling it was decided to set up an engineering and assurance team for all Jarvis LNW projects.  The team was built to cover compliance and the build up of all core works / Health and Safety files, to manage Track Quality, look after Document Control and be the line management for all Engineering Managers and all discipline&#x2019;s Responsible Engineers.  The position reported to the Managing Director of the division.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Chief S&amp;T Engineer:  As well as Engineering Management, the role of Chief S&amp;T Engineer was undertaken.  This takes the responsibility of internal resource and competence approvals and standards review / briefing.<br>
Whilst in these roles, Contractor&#x2019;s Engineering Manager roles within project teams continued.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Rugby Station Re-modelling:  Jarvis scope on Rugby Station remodelling was Track (plain line and S&amp;C) as well as Overhead Line.  Design was procured by Network Rail meaning Jarvis&#x2019; involvement started with the constructability review / IDC stage and through an internal approvals process prior to issuing for construction.  An important development was a system of ongoing assurance checks by the engineering team in an effort to ensure hand back can be achieved.  During construction any technical queries or field changes were managed by the team and coordinated by the CEM.  Finally the as-built process and compliance management matters were the responsibility of the CEM.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Northampton Re-Control:  Responsibilities for the CEM as other projects.  Scope here was design and construction for signalling renewals (SSI) with some minor permanent way remodelling and the associated OLE.  There was also an interface with the FTN project for the transmission system.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Mentorship of other CEMs:  As overall engineering manager for LNW projects, the role of mentor for the CEMs on Milton Keynes enabling, TV4T S&amp;C and A09 works.</p>

Renewal of Brightside Interlocking:  This was one of Network Rail's national top ten priority schemes.  Although an interlocking renewal, signal sighting complications have led to a near complete re-signalling, and includes some permanent way remodelling.  The remodelling was an upgrade of a reception siding to a passenger loop, including traxcavating two sets of trap points, and a rationalisation of some other areas of the sidings.  IRJ alterations are also required, including those on CWR requiring welding and stressing.    The interlocking is to be a modern equivalent route relay interlocking and all line side locations are to be renewed, leading to the provision of two new REBs.  The Signalling Supply Point was also upgraded and housed in a new brick built building.  Multidisciplinary AIP has been managed by Jarvis as is detailed design and Form B works.  All construction works are being controlled in house, with only civils works being sub-contracted.  Supply of new TDM and Emergency Panel, and Sheffield panel alterations have been sourced</p>

    <p class="description">&#xf0d8;	Norton and Brock Level Crossings, MWL to MSL Conversions:  Two level crossings on the West Coast Main Line.  Both these crossings were MWLs that were being upgraded to MSLs to enable the Line Speed Increase works.  The projects were taken from GRIP 4 through to implementation.  Norton was developed in the existing relay room and Brock into new location cases.  Civils works were managed in house, as well as the signalling and permanent way (IRJ) requirements.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Switch &amp; Crossing and Plain Line Renewals:  Part of the Integrated Management Team for the &#xa3;80m pa S&amp;C and Plain Line renewals contract.

Engineering Manager functions for this scheme extended to competence management, briefings, incident investigation and the development of new systems to improve process.  The role also managed special technical client requests.<br>
&#xf0d8;	Line Speed Enhancement signalling works for the West Coast Main Line Route 2(N) and Route 2(S):  Responsible for all the engineering aspects of the works including signal moves, robust train protection and the associated IRJ (all CWR), TPWS and AWS works.  This scheme was fully multi-disciplinary and included large amounts of civil engineering enabling works, including the approvals management of a novel helical mono-pile with angle wing cap,  as well as signal sighting overhead line works.  There was also a mixture of telecomm technologies requiring works for SPT moves.  Responsible for the day to day management of the engineering, design &amp; test teams, totalling approximately forty people.  This project was successfully commissioned after five months, site works being implemented from Crewe to Acton Grange and AIP works approved to Preston.</p>
