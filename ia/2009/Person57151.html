            <h2>David R. Crais&#8217;s Summary</h2>

He also held a position as an asset manager under contract with Resolution Trust Corporation managing distressed assets from failed S&amp;L's.  Experience that gives him insight into today's capital and property markets.  <br>
Licensed in securities and capital markets, insurance, real estate, mortgage finance, and contractor management; and certified in project management, healthcare administration, marketing technology, business process management (BPM), and negotiation skillls: he is well versed in the training and professional development necessary to drive change, face complex and challenging issues, and know how to get things done - and do it.

    <p class="description">(As many of my colleagues know, due to my wife and infant children being in a severe car accident in October 2003, which left all  three of them hospitalized, I was forced to eventually leave this position to care for them.  Thankfully, they are all well now with the exception of a few minor ailments.  Quest Diagnostics was very generous in their financial and spiritual support.  It was an honor leading the turnaround of the business unit in 2003)<br>
<br>
Recruited by Quest management in mid-2002 to lead Turnaround of failing business unit.  Unit had net losses in 2000, 2001, and 2002 before I took over.  Quest invited me in since they were a legacy investor in my previous employer, Careside, from their purchase of Smith Kline Beechum Labs, our former parent company.  We returned to profitablity with over 38% positive net margins under my stewardship by the end of June,Q2: 2003.  This was done by a reallocation of the sales strategy from basic testing to Genomic and Esoteric testing, along with POL IT infrastructure deployment.  Genomic and Esoteric testing increased our average revenue per test (CPT) from $14 per test for basics to approx $136 per test for genomic and esoteric testing.  I led the retraining of the sales force to achieve these goals as well. Managed sales and field operations team launching field diagnostic services from Louisiana market into Mississippi expansion market.  9 direct reports and 20 indirect.   Physician office, hospitals and health networks, and ambulatory care center base.  Corporate and government accounts:casino's, shipbuilders, teacher's union, and NASA facilities.<br>
Created phlebotomy 'patient-service-center' network: site selection, lease negotiation, build-out, courier logistics. <br>
 Top 6 district performance out of 82 Quest operating districts.   Top turnaround district.  President's Club. Over $36,000,000 revenue.  Six-Sigma trained.</p>

Managed over $20,000,000 portfolio of over 400 residential and commercial properties in Southeast Louisiana.  Properties auctioned off by 1992.  (We will probably see a similar entity to the RTC created in the near future for the real property assets associated with the Collateralized Mortgage and Collateralized Debt Obligations.  The U.S. Treasury Dept. TARP and TARF plans have yet to address this surplus.  Until they do, the market will not reset.  We saw that in the late 1980's and early 90's with the S&amp;L's until the RTC was created).</p>
