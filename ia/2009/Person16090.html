    <p class="description">Back to Basics&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Gloria Jean&#x2019;s is and continues to be a fantastic company to work for. Operating now in over 36 countries with some 1000 stores and close to 10,000 employees world-wide, Gloria Jean&#x2019;s was the new challenge I had been looking for. Initially I was brought in as a consultant to help fix some of their IT initiatives, and roll out an online training platform. Shortly after starting I was offered the full-time role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) and jumped at it.<br>
<br>
Gloria Jean's Coffees is one of the world&#x2019;s most successful franchise brands and is wholly Australian owned and operated having purchased the global rights for the Gloria Jean&#x2019;s brand in 2005. Currently they are the second largest specialty coffee retailer in the world and one of the fastest growing franchise organizations. <br>
<br>
Reporting directly to the Global CEO I am responsible for the technical operation and direction of Gloria Jean&#x2019;s Coffees internationally. The role is broad and covers everything from servers, to workstations, to disaster recovery and business continuity plans, to web portals, to online training systems, to point of sale technology, to sales and product mix polling, to benchmarking systems, to presenting internationally to franchise partners and the board etc. Basically I am charged with providing the technology vision and leadership for the company to ensure capability and consistency across the brand. <br>
<br>
In 2007 when I started, there was no IT team and it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for the network to be down until 10 am or so before users could log onto their PC&#x2019;s. There was no technical capability and very limited systems running on obsolete hardware. In 2008 a little over 18 months later, Gloria Jean's won  the award for &quot;Franchise Innovation of the Year&quot; for the rollout of our web-based extranet / online training solution &#x2013; the project I had originally been recruited for.</p>

    <p class="description">It&#x2019;s all about me&#x2026;<br>
<br>
After a year with Decide Interactive it was time to run my own business again and so I established Sustainable IT. Sustainable IT was started as a venture to capitalise on my SEO knowledge and my team and I ended up operating over 2,500 web properties simultaneously world-wide with some 1 million plus active users. <br>
<br>
We specialised in the development and management of online communities and became one of Google&#x2019;s highest paid affiliates in Australia (if not globally) and was a member of the informal Google Fedex Club. Over the course of the years with so many sites to manage we developed considerable expertise in outsourced web development, rapid prototyping of web concepts, and global hosting with employees in Australia, England, the Netherlands, India, China and Russia. In 2003 we started developing sites and content specifically for mobile phones with micro payment billing and later other web connected devices such as video ipods. <br>
<br>
Sustainable IT was a fantastic business that allowed me to travel the world while generating a passive income with little ongoing involvement required. After 5 years though I was missing my retail roots. In early 2007 Sustainable IT and its web properties was sold to a private investor.</p>

    <p class="description">It&#x2019;s all about the Traffic&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Part of my role at Halescom as Technical Director had been to develop methods to drive traffic to our web portals to maximize our market share and subsequently top-line sales. Having sold Halescom and looking for something to do, in 2001 I was asked by another friend to come and join his new start-up web marketing and search engine optimization company &#x2013; Decide Interactive. <br>
<br>
Decide was one of Australia&#x2019;s first Search Engine Optimisation companies providing consulting services to most of Australia&#x2019;s leading blue chip organisations including AMEX, News Corp, Fairfax, NRMA. <br>
<br>
At Decide our team held the #1 result for the term &#x201c;search engine optimisation&#x201d; on Google for 6 consecutive months which was unprecedented in the industry. Most colleagues have since gone on to become senior players in Google, Yahoo, and other large search companies. <br>
<br>
My role was effectively a client-facing hardcore SEO strategist and developed and implemented strategies to drive highly targeted web traffic to Australia&#x2019;s premier portals. <br>
<br>
Decide Interactive enjoyed massive success and was subsequently bought by 24/7 Real Media, Inc. (Nasdaq code: TFSM) in 2004.</p>

    <p class="description">The dot com boom&#x2026;<br>
<br>
Halescom was a start-up Technology Company, which I co-founded with 3 other partners. The company grew from 4 employees in August 1999 to over 90 employees with a monthly sales volume of over $1 million. <br>
<br>
Halescom was based on the Wholesale Direct model but now instead of being a direct to consumer site, it was set up to supply a MASSIVE range of I.T. and consumer electronic products to some of Australia&#x2019;s largest web portals via their own branded web shops but powered by Halescom. <br>
<br>
In short the technology we pioneered provided a full outsourcing solution for third party ecommerce strategies wishing to take advantage of the dot com boom and the massive surge in consumer IT interest. We launched many new technologies in Australia including reverse auctions for buying groups, payment gateways for multi-site locations, co-brandable stores and more. <br>
<br>
In 2001 Halescom was successfully sold to an energy provider, CBD Energy Limited (ASX code: CBD)</p>

    <p class="description">Computer Way on Steroids&#x2026;<br>
<br>
In 1999 a good friend from University who was working at Harvey Norman at the time was offered a job opening the very first Harvey Norman Computer Superstore in South Australia. Having spent close to 10 years at Computer Way I was ready for a change and a chance to prove myself on my own so accepted a similar offer and in November 2009 arrived in Adelaide to an empty concrete shell still in the stages of being fitted out. <br>
<br>
Harvey Norman was a truly eye-opening experience. In the one year I spent at Harvey&#x2019;s I learnt more about retailing than I had in my 2 degrees and 8 or so years in our own computer retail business. Whereas we operated as a low margin high service value add business where 10% margins well below the recommended retail price  were the norm; at Harvey&#x2019;s the RRP was only the starting point. An amazing business that continues to be viewed as the retail benchmark today.<br>
<br>
After 2 months on the floor I was promoted to Commercial Manager which simply meant that I looked after the major accounts and got an office of my own. A rarity in a Harvey Norman store. <br>
<br>
By 2000 the dot com boom was in full swing with Y2K vendors having taken advantage of all the pre 2000 IT expenditure and looking for the next IT cash cow &#x2013; luckily we had Wholesale Direct which by now was well and truly booming in its own right.<br>
<br>
Back to Sydney I went.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Where the journey started...<br>
<br>
Computer Way was a family business started in 1990 when PC's were first becoming financially accessible to the masses. During my university holidays I would work as both a sales assistant and as a technician. At the time we ran a Bulletin Board Service (BBS) to provide tech support as well as shareware games and files to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and loosely provide a 24 hour support mechanism. The problem with BBS&#x2019;s is they operated over phone lines so only one user could connect per line at a time. In late 1993 the first mainstream browsers were released and users could graphically access the web for the first time. The big break-through was now that over a phone line you could now have multiple users accessing the one connection to get information and download files. <br>
<br>
Around the same time at the end of 1993 l was contacted by one of my old lecturers who knew I was in computers and offered me a place in one of the first true dedicated IT degrees in Australia at CSU-Mitchell. In 1994 I enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology &#x2013; majoring in Information Systems. While studying IT, I became increasingly aware that users from all over Australia were now accessing our shop in Chatswood, and intrigued we uploaded a spreadsheet of all our prices and we were inundated with orders. We had learnt that using the power of the newly emerging web we could expand our retail audience from consumers in the local area to consumers all over Australia. In the days when most businesses were still using faxes to send out their business offerings, we were using email to send newsletters with pricing specials Australia wide.<br>
<br>
In 1996 I graduated from University and with my newly formed IT expertise combined with my sales and marketing we started to really push the online sales. In 1998 we launched one of the first true e-commerce sites in Australia called Wholesale Direct that allowed automated online payment processing.</p>
