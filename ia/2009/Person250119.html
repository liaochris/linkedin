            <h2>Yomar Lopez [ yomar.lopez@gmail.com ]&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                You hear it a lot: the marketplace has changed so the professional must evolve.  Information Technology is one of those unique fields to be in because it is still not given the prestige and respect of other professional vocations, for reasons that are well beyond the scope of this summary.  IT is still treated like a cost center yet technology is probably the single most effective asset for creating value and driving the bottomline in any business, aside from a bulletproof business plan and well-executed marketing plan.<br>
<br>
I have well over 10 years of experience in IT, due to an early start supporting information systems in the academic and small business environments.  I do freelance writing and provide business services of all sorts, which has allowed me to connect with other small business owners, professionals, and friends.  I also have extensive experience doing sales &amp; marketing work so, really, I have worn quite a few metaphorical hats.  I keep busy and dabble in different things.<br>
<br>
I enjoy what I do and I love taking on new challenges.  I'm not looking for the dream job offer though (let's face it: no one becomes financially secure/independent at a job these days), if it comes, I will certainly explore it.  Just looking to meet some people and perhaps people achieve their goals.  Absolutely free of cost, unless, of course, you want the premium services! *wink wink*<br>
<br>
My goals here are short and simple: educate people on the real possibilities that are out there and how they can prepare themselves.  I am a defender of truth and justice (insert heroic music here)!  Most people will feed you stuff they learned in a text book or heard from a supposed &quot;expert&quot; (whatever that means).  I am offering my life lessons and hope you can benefit from my experiences.  Why?  Cause I care about people, good people that just need a big break. 8)<br>
<br>
Shout-outs to all my Pace, BOE, NYIF, and C3i buddies.  Nice to catch y'all on here!

              <p class="skills">
                I'm one of those rare people persons and, as such, I'd say my best skills lie in providing excellent customer service and communicating effectively, especially in the written form.  To me, customer service is about remembering what it is to be the customer and treating them the way you would like to be treated.  That and managing expectations - that's HUGE!  Warm connections - that's where it all really happens.. The magic of networking!!  Curious?  Just ask!

    <p class="description">Certainly not the most illustrious of positions that I've held but I enjoy it.  When the commissions are big, they're BIG. More importantly, I like networking and helping people so this is a great opportunity on both ends.  Seriously, most retail folks only seem to know how to read data sheets and regurgitate the same few lies that go around.  I actually have a passion for electronics and technology so I can give REAL opinions and information.  Go figure!</p>

    <p class="description">After seeing the many unsettling things in the service industry and small business arena, I decided that it was time to help bring about some change.  Several of my clients would ask me for business advice and services outside of IT and, eventually, Two Guys &amp; A Pencil (o.k.a. TGAP) was born.  We're still very young and growing slowly but our goal is to help stimulate the economy, create more jobs, and organically-expand small businesses that may otherwise fail in an increasingly-competitive marketplace.  We do this not by providing the expert advice, best design strategies, or even the highest-quality services.  Those things are all bunk yet people continue to promise it.  We simply offer real advice and practical solutions that will bridge the gap (hence the moniker &quot;TGAP&quot;) between the soft and technical sides of business.  How we do this is where it gets interesting but that's for another time and place...  BTW, Nicholas Teri is the other half of TGAP.  He's the &quot;Art Guy&quot;.</p>

    <p class="description">The folks at Michael Alan are all great.  These folks understand that, in this changing consumer market, you have to do something extraordinary to catch a potential buyer's attention.  They practically reinvented guerrilla marketing and certainly have redefined it.  I still keep in touch with the folks over at MAG and have the occasional project come my way but this sort of work is purely project-driven and, thus, not very sustainable as a bill-paying option.  Those of you out there that do freelance or consulting work should know exactly what I mean!  Good times have been had with the MAG team, that's for sure.  I was also invited to their last Christmas party which is only for their elite marketing folks so YAY me!</p>

    <p class="description">Though many will snear at the mere though of doing sales, the MLM and Direct Sales model is widely-adopted in companies all over the world, including businesses that just about everyone is doing business with.  They may dress it up but chances are that your bank, ISP, or other servicer has a similar division or business model that it has adopted.  I believe what Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. does is brilliant and, though my focus has shifted elsewhere, to my very own unique business models, I think anyone who does not see the urgency in these services is essentially blind or close-minded.  Alas, people fear anything sales-related (apparently, it's all right to help people so long as you do not profit from it - does your own livelihood not matter??) yet we all do sales and marketing in some shape or form, interestingly enough..  But I digress...  Long-live the Stonecipher dream!</p>

    <p class="description">I started off this position as a temp contractor and was soon brought in as a permanent helpdesk analyst.  I quickly moved up to a more senior/team lead position and eventually management.  As is often expected, titles in IT mean very little so I could best descibe my work as that of a business liaison, trainer/mentor, database administrator, team coordinator, hardware repair supervisor, knowledge manager, and third-tier support analyst.  I did all the odds-and-ends work and overlapped with the rest of the management team.  Naturally, this meant I didn't get nearly the amount of credit I deserve but I wasn't in it for a pat on the back; in the end, I knew I delivered value to our clients and made sure our support teams were more proactive.</p>

    <p class="description">This was a long-term contract with HP that, sadly, ran into the bad luck that a lot of other great opportunities did for me: there was poor management at the top and the folks at the bottom suffer for it.  Prior to starting this project, I was doing the whole moonlighting spiel, doing some creative writing as a ghost writer and web content developer as well as the usual IT contracts, and then I was approached by a nice gentleman, Mr. Roventini.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed this position because I got to help several retail locations increase their sales by educating the staff on the benefits of HP equipment and providing realistic selling points, not mere marketing hype.  This was completely a self-starter position.  Many did the bare minimum but we were given the ability to run with it.  I tried my best to create great incentive programs and contests to get the sales staff engaged in actively selling HP products and it actually worked, for the most part.<br>
<br>
If I could do it again, I definitely would!</p>

    <p class="description">Linear was one of the many IT consulting firms I worked for.  This was an interesting situation because I came in from a company I loved, reuniting with an old friend, business partner, and co-worker, Brandon Yuen.  I had left Unified Technologies because, after being acquired by Cogni-Case Incorporated, the typical downsizing fun began.  The experience at Linear was great, in spite of some shady business practices and bad management at the very top.<br>
<br>
The primary business of Linear was the cabling and telecommunications side.  When Brandon and I teamed up, we brought in new clients and made the data services side of the business much more lucrative.  Sadly, our success came to a screeching hault when the Director we reported to directly ran away with some of the company's money.  Again, I was forced to jump ship and, fortunately, one of our clients decided to bring me on-board on a permanent basis... Hurrah!</p>

    <p class="description">Working for one of Pearson's smallest shops was interesting.  I learned a lot about the politics of IT and the beauty of IT.  I worked for a charmingly narcissistic gentleman that made it his point to hog up credit for my initiatives and big saves.  At the time, I really cared about the metaphorical &quot;pat on the back&quot; so the combination of this and many pivotal events in my life forced me to move on.  When they say things like this are a blessing in disguise, it is true.  This company started off being a fun, challenging learning experience.  I put in much overtime because I loved what I was doing but, in the end, management changes came in, people rid high horses, and I was spent.  After 9/11, the offices I helped erect were gone.  It was traumatic but it only made me stronger...</p>

    <p class="description">Though this was a position where I made the least amount of money yet put in the most time, I loved working at Pace because of the people.  Of course, I fell into the trap of joining start-up's and dot-coms that threw lots of money and nice employment packages at me.  I was foolish but I do not regret it though I will never forget my many experiences at Pace University.  I tried my hands in everything there: teaching, team leadership, project management, software testing, server administration, network wiring, printer repair, and so much more.  My advice to any IT professional is to work in at least one university environment.  The pay is not as competitive most of the time and it is surprisingly more cut-throat than one would think but the exposure and learning experiences at every corner mixed in with the networking potential makes it completely worth it.</p>

      <p class="notes">My experience at Pace University was very much fulfilling.  I made life-long friends and business contacts, had some great times, and learned a lot about the ubiquitous &quot;real world&quot; everyone speaks of.  Prior to that, I had tons of IT experience but Pace was where I truly got passionate about my work.  I miss Pace and may some day return in some capacity but, for now, my path seems to lead in another direction.  Thanks to all the decision makers at Pace that allowed me to try my hand in teaching and made me feel like an integral part of the team when I was part of the DoIT/CSO group.  Good times, good times...</p>

      <p class="notes">It was at GAS that I really got into computers and IT work.  There, often fixed our mostly-dilapidated Apple systems.  Fond memories include finding Carmen San Diego SEVERAL times (total ownage) and fixing those durn 5.4'' floppy drives.  I've always been pretty handy with computers, which is why I was the designated techie everywhere I went, especially at school.  When I finally graduated GAS and went to XHS, I would become a developer of their BBS as well as keeper of all things computing.  GAS paved the way!</p>

There are too many lemmings in the world and not enough true leaders.  I admire folks like Ariel Wampol, Seth Godin, Harry Beckwith, Regis McKenna, Kim Klaver, Jim Rohn, and Barack Obama because they are real, no-BS kind of people.</p>

                  I am a former IEEE associate.  Thinking of becoming more active in IT again and taking an active role in IEEE events, discussions, and projects.  I try to attend business mixers, product launches, professional forums, and other events just to meet people that share similar interests and worldviews.  Currently, I have been traveling a bit and meeting new people, considering my next big moves.

                I have some but those things are over-rated.  The greatest reward, to me, is knowing you made a difference in someone's life.  I rather have made an impact in the lives of a few than be recognized by many for having glorified pieces of paper, thank you very much.  Jaded?  Not at all.  I've just transcended to a level where I value peace of mind, bringing joy to others, and being true to my heart's desires and passions.  If you only pursue things that make you passionate and put in 150%, you will always be happy but, if you worry about recognition and compensation, you'll find disappointment around every corner.  Words to live by...
