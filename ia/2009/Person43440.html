    <p class="description">I am still CEO.  It was founded on technology that a CTO I hired and paid $200,000 to build to create leads.  The  technology did not work. He went on a tirade attacking me, the Company and investors violating the Company Operating Agreement and was terminated in July, 2008 and all interests in the Company revoked.  He continues attacking me and the Company on a website with initials ROR.  He was placed under a 3 year no contact, no stress injunction by State of Utah, which he continues to break.  He filed false documents Utah and a large National Bank AFTER he was terminated from the Company.  He is currently under cease and desist, yet he continues to attack with libelous information on the Internet.  Our Counsel is seeking return of the $200,000, to have him remove all of the libelous information on the Internet, and a formal retraction for the stress he has cause me, my wife, the Company.  I will continue as CEO of the Company until all proper legal action against him is complete.</p>

1. A multiple merchant Debit Card carried on the American Express Networks.  <br>
<br>
2. Building a processing interface allowing merchant's individual debit gift cards to be registered as a loyalty card for Upromise members.  <br>
<br>
I introduced the company to a substantial network of my personal contacts in the Merchant &amp; Incentive businesses.  <br>
<br>
The acquisition model included developing Internet and offline marketing strategies at the School District and school building level.  <br>
<br>
I secured the 1st ever School District level fundraising agreement in history with Houston ISD. <br>
<br>
I also negotiated contracts with WebEx, Scholastic, and negotiated a compelling offer from a Time Warner subsidiary to provide magazine subscription services to the company.</p>

    <p class="description">I was on the Executive Committee.  The Company had debit and stored value relationships with Visa, Discover and MasterCard. These platforms made the company one of the leading Debit Card competitors in the Debit Card Shopping Mall channel. <br>
<br>
The company also processed individual stored value gift cards for national merchants through its proprietary software and a relationship with ValueLink, a subsidiary of First Data.  <br>
<br>
While there, I personally built a loyalty stored value card accepted by over 70 national merchants using the Discover Debit Card network.  This card was built for the corporate incentive and K-12 school fundraising industries.  It included merchants such as Lowe's Home Improvement, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Circuit City, LinensNThings, Hollywood Video, Boston Market, Cabela's, Dillard's, etc.  <br>
<br>
The card was a Discover Stored Value Card.  It was the first card ever created that allowed multiple merchants logos to be printed and co-marketed on the face of the card.</p>

    <p class="description">I helped pioneer the concept of electronic rebates from merchants to raise money for schools and children's organizations.<br>
<br>
We hosted an Electronic Merchant Rebate Symposium with 38 National Merchants attending.<br>
<br>
We were on the cutting edge of fostering a market environment providing consulting services for numerous national merchants in the area of developing loyalty networks and/or the pre-development of converting corporate gift certificates to gift cards.  We also did work on the Merit Value Debit Card redemption system in Ohio.<br>
<br>
In addition, we participated in a nationwide effort to see if the Smart Cards would achieve acceptance in the U.S. market as a incentive and merchant loyalty product.<br>
<br>
We also developed the very first private label ISP with AT&amp;T and numerous other &#x201c;firsts&#x201d; working with AT&amp;T at the highest levels.<br>
<br>
In addition, we completed an enormously successful loyalty campaign with Shaw&#x2019;s Grocery in New England increasing their marketing results by over 500%.</p>
