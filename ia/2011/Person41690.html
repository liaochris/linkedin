Letter of recommendation excerpt: <br>
<br>
&quot;Steven, I was very pleased&#x2014;and impressed&#x2014;with the thorough, painstaking approach of your usability analysis for my adult-literacy book's site, www.seejanerun.net, and your valuable recommendations will result in a much stronger site when we finish incorporating them. It's obvious you have an intuitive grasp of effective Web design &amp; writing for the Web. You understand what works, and what doesn't, and why.<br>
<br>
I had never before used a usability analyst, so I prepared for an avalanche of negative feedback about the site's shortcomings. However, I found the depth and clarity of your Web-site critique both thoughtful &amp; illuminating. Some of the potential improvements you identified we had already decided on, but the vast majority of them came as pleasant surprises (&#x2014;and some as a shock!). Both Dan &amp; I had known, without being able to put our finger on why, that our Web pages were not working effectively for us.<br>
<br>
Your analysis makes evident that our original Web-site designer's work left much to be desired. In fact, we've terminated her work for us&#x2014;she didn't even want to hear any of your recommendations&#x2014;and begun to solicit bids to revamp the site based, in large part, on your analysis.<br>
<br>
I was particularly impressed with your recommendations on how to revise our site's content with stronger sales copy (calls to action, etc.), and on how to promote and market the site both online and off. As you predicted, our site didn't come up in any returns at the major search engines; when I confronted our developer with this, she said she charges &quot;extra&quot; for that kind of basic service!<br>
<br>
Again, many, many thanks for your help. I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate it, and I will certainly recommend your considerable expertise and valuable services to anyone who wants to improve their Web site.&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;In my 20 years of software and multimedia development, Steven Spenser has impressed me as one of the best [PR] strategists I have ever met. His PR &amp; marketing expertise has been critical to our ...Internet-software launch, and [we] could not have come so far, so quickly, without his expert counsel.<br>
<br>
Steven made huge contributions to our market research &amp; competitive intelligence, compiling an extensive list of competitors &amp; discovering new competitors in many categories. He also played a major role in the overhaul of our Web site: His design recommendations led to significant improvements &amp; he wrote/edited much of [our earlier versions'] copy. He also edited much of our marketing/publicity materials to ensure that our product's user benefits and PR themes were applied consistently.<br>
<br>
I'm very impressed with Steven's PR &amp; media-relations skills, but even more...with his strategic marketing vision. From the outset, he intuitively understood [our products'] key benefits &amp; marketing opportunities, when other high-tech marketers I approached couldn't even grasp the inherent concepts. Steven is the only PR professional I've met who really &quot;gets&quot; online marketing; he routinely produces great ideas that keep me excited to be working w/ him.<br>
<br>
The depth &amp; scope of Steven's comprehensive PR plan for the launch of our product was very impressive [and] was filled with useful ideas &amp; strategies.<br>
<br>
Steven is the best PR/marketing writer I have ever known, and his press releases are highly effective. Whether he's polishing our drafts or producing original material, he always crafts real gems that not only get to the heart of the subject &amp; make all our marketing points, but are newsworthy &amp; interesting to read.<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for Steven's efforts on behalf of MicroSurfer... He has been an invaluable resource for us, and I wish him great success.&quot;<br>

FROM RECOMMENDATION LETTER:<br>
<br>
&quot;Steven Spenser's outstanding accomplishments as state public-affairs director played a vital role in making our Washington State Chapter one of the most successful of The Concord Coalition's 50 chapters...Thanks to Steven's professional expertise, our chapter's 1993 launch received a tremendous amount of publicity both in the Seattle media and throughout the state--more than any Concord Coalition chapter ever.<br>
<br>
Steven's effective press kits and media-relations skills generated a well-attended press conference, an [AP] wire story, editorial endorsements [and] placements in [10] papers around the state. Steven successfully placed The Concord Coalition in live interviews (some featuring him as spokesman) on [every major Seattle news-radio station], on 4 of 5 daily newscasts on KIRO-TV and on &quot;Seattle Week in Review&quot; on KCTS-TV. He orchestrated five placements in The Seattle Times, including an editorial endorsement &amp; a favorable editorial column. As a result of this phenomenal publicity, the chapter...was catapulted into the national organization's top rank virtually overnight.<br>
<br>
Steven's dynamic efforts brought significant visibility to The Concord Coalition, increased our membership &amp; established credibility with the media &amp; the national organization. I am deeply grateful to have had the benefit of Steven's impressive abilities at such a critical juncture for our chapter.&quot;<br>

Steven planned &amp; organized all the stories for each issue; directed the research, story sourcing and development; expertly liaised with 5 national &amp; international affiliated organizations cooperating on the publication; and wrote &amp; edited all the copy for each monthly issue. <br>
<br>
Steven has impressed everyone here with his ability to remain calm and cool under deadline pressure, and to deliver top-notch, professional work on time. He routinely kept everything under perfect control, flawlessly organizing a myriad of details.<br>

Steven originally was hired to produce only the first newsletter issue on an emergency basis. His work during his first 3 days on the job was so outstanding his account manager recommended he be confirmed as the writer &amp; editor for all six issues. <br>
<br>
I am extremely impressed with Steven's talent, skills and ability and am profoundly grateful for the remarkable work he did in getting our newsletter off the ground. I look forward to Steven's return to the EvansGroup team when more work is available...I can recommend Steven without reservation as an extremely proficient writer &amp; a valuable team player capable of extraordinary results.

<br>
&quot;In the more than 3 years that Steven managed our divisional budget he was responsible for maintaining an annual account of well over a million dollars of government funds. At no time has he ever given me the slightest reason to doubt his ability, integrity or reliability. <br>
<br>
Steven has been an outstanding budget manager, all the more so since he was given the position with no prior experience. Where other divisions often employed trained military-supply personnel...Steven was chosen for a highly critical position outside his professional area of expertise, and transformed himself into an exemplary accountant. He took a rudimentary...budget operation &amp; built it into the best-supported account in the {Engineering] department, implementing numerous organizational modifications that greatly streamlined &amp; improved the efficiency of our recordkeeping and material-identification procedures.<br>
<br>
His acknowledged expertise in the arcane field of military requisitioning &amp; budget reconciliation was such that...[h]e routinely interfaced with facets of the Department of Defense supply system of which most other... budget managers have never heard, to the degree normally approached only by professional supply personnel. <br>
<br>
Steven has demonstrated an ability to complete any project, regardless of scope, on or ahead of schedule. He applies a thorough and complete attention to detail to every assignment. His accounting has been impeccable; he has never failed to balance any fund or account for every penny of the monies entrusted to him. I have relied upon his initiative, perseverance and dedication to provide me with results as could no other budget manager in my experience. I had only to tell him what I required and he would quickly provide it.<br>
<br>
...I most highly recommend him without reservation. I am confident you will find Steven as impressive as I did.&quot;<br>
