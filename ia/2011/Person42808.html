    <h2>Terry Drayton&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        I'm a &quot;serial entrepreneur&quot; who over the past 25 years has founded and managed seven successful companies and raised more than $500M in capital for them. Originally from Canada my family moved to Seattle in 1997. I'm best known as the co-founder &amp; CEO of HomeGrocer.com which I led to $400M in sales and 2500 staff before selling it in June of 2000 for $1.1B to Webvan.  Other than Bob Swan they turned out to be complete idiots and bankrupted it a year later. I won the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for the Pacific Northwest in 1999 for HomeGrocer.com and in 2008 was a finalist for Arena/Ramp. <br>
<br>
I greatly enjoy both the art and science of start-ups and started my PhD to become an entrepreneurship professor but left to start HomeGrocer.com. For more than a decade I've participated as an executive board member at the University of Washington's Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and regular guest speaker, business plan judge and mentor.<br>
<br>
I've been fortunate to be involved as a board member for a number of world class businesses including eNom (the second largest domain registrar in the world), Naverus (pioneers in GPS navigation for commercial airliners) and Xcerion (pioneers in cloud computing).

    <p class="description">Rainier is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business that provides online registration and management software. We support a number of markets including sports and camps (Count Me In brand), classes and events (Turnstile Systems brand), alumni groups (Alumni Software brand) and everything else (All Registrations brand). <br>
<br>
We're one of the largest companies in our markets and our clients tell us that it's because of our great software and different business model. The features of our software are unparalled in the industry and we regularly enhance it based on client and channel partner requests. It's easy to use and fully integrated saving our clients time and effort. Our business model is simple. Unlike our competitors, Rainier doesn't handle client funds. Instead clients set-up their own account for debt/credit cards and eChecks with all funds flowing immediately and directly to cthe clients bank account. And more than anything else Rainier is really easy to work with. Our pricing is competitive and published on our website. We include telephone support and your sales person remains your contact throughout.<br>
<br>
For our Count Me In brand we've partnered with a leading merchandise provider to offer a fully integrated team store (item shipped directly to purchasers). We're looking for other great channel partners for all our brands. <br>
<br>
Rainier purchased the assets and clients of Arena Group out of bankruptcy on May 20, 2009. We immediately reached out to all the former clients who had lost money and offered them a way to recoup the funds they had lost. More than 30% have now taken us up on this offer. After trying out the competition many more have been coming back advising us that our solution is both way better and more economical. We hope they all come back!</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">I founded Arena Group based on many years experience as a volunteer with youth sports, education and other organizations. These organizations really needed a &quot;Microsoft Office&quot; Software-as-a-Service suite of applications for online registration, donations, volunteering, merchandise sales and management. By being good listeners and constant innovators we built an amazing, industry leading products that provides significant benefits for our clients. I was part-time focusing on software development until May 2008 when I joined full-time to  try and raise a $10M institutional round of financing. Given where the business was and my track record that should have been easy. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately our timing was terrible and the global financial meltdown made it impossible. We tried everything we could think of to save the company and got really close several times. Lawsuits begat a media frenzy then our main subsidiary was forced into involuntary bankruptcy by three justifiably upset clients. Although it was Chapter 7 Liquidation which meant we would typically have been shut down immediately, we got lucky with a great trustee and were able to keep the business running for clients for four months until a sale could be made. The experience was painful but with a lot of valuable learning. It was my first bankruptcy in nearly 25 years as an entrepreneur and will also be my last!</p>

    <p class="description">I co-founded Ramp with Bob Duffy, Ken Deering, Rob Jones and Richard Eller early into the dot com meltdown. We had all enjoyed working together at HomeGrocer.com and wanted to offer our world class expertise as consultants to companies interesting in getting involved with eCommerce and custom application development. We were fortunate to attract some great customers and grew the business each year. We worked with many start-ups which is a passion of mine. We started doing project work for Microsoft who quicly became our largest customer, a position they still hold today. Our first hire Robb Nielsen became a partner and founded our user experience (UX) practice and did some amazing work for many clients. <br>
<br>
We recruited great staff, with an average of 15 years experience, allowing us to deliver great work for our clients. We grew the business to 100+ professional staff in Bellevue, added an India office led by long time staffer Vijay Valamanchili with 50+ professional staff and grew revenues to more than $14 million in 2008. In 2007 Ramp was also recognized by WTIA as Service Provider of the Year and as one of the fastest growing companies on the Inc. 5000. I left Ramp in April 2008 to work full time at Arena Group and helped recruit new CEO John Frankovitch. I remain a shareholder.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">HomeGrocer.com was an amazing journey. The idea was inspired by my wife Beth on a cold, wintry night in Toronto back in 1994 when we were out of groceries in our house for our our young children. It was the Internet and the advent of eCommerce that made delivering groceries to the home practical. Through EO I hooked up with Mike Donald and James Fierro in Vancouver who had a similar idea. Ken Deering was quickly enlisted and soon we were working from our first facility in Seattle. We leveraged all our combined learnings across grocery, distribution, technology and marketing and everything we could copy from companies we admired like Costco, Nordstrom, Starbucks and Amazon. Yet time and again we literally imagined new capabilities and then figured out how to build them.<br>
<br>
The pace was frenetic on all fronts: staff, products, facilities, trucks customers and fundraising. Staffing went from three in the fall of 1997 to more than 2500 three years later. A year after launching in Seattle we open in Portland, then down to Orange County a few months later. Soon we were opening a facility each month. Our tri-temperature peach trucks were everywhere! The pace of growth, dramatically fasted than we had planned, meant HomeGrocer.com had a voracious appetite for capital with over $400 million raised to support the business. Sales grew to an annualized run rate of over $400 million which was huge amount back in 2000. <br>
<br>
We attracted the absolute top tier of partners such as Madrona, Kleiner Perkins, Jim Barksdale, Liberty Media, Martha Stewart and Amazon. Our invesment bankers were Morgan Stanley led by the uber diligent Mary Meeker. HomeGrocer.com went public on March 10, 2000, the day the NASDAQ peaked, and it quickly came undone. We'd spent 18 months gearing up to open 2 new facilities a month and had made hundreds of million leases and other commitments to accomplish it. Whereas the capital to fund this growth had previously been unlimited overnight it was unavailable</p>

    <p class="description">With my cousin Richard Drayton I co-founded Aquaterra to purchase the Canadian bottled water assets of Nestle - the brands Crystal Springs and Labrador. Operations were extensive across Ontario and Quebec with nearly a dozen facilities, hundreds of trucks and employees. We partnered with the legendary Canadian entrepreneur Bud Wilmot and his sons David and Michael with Scotiabank as financial partner. Aquaterra immediately became the largest bottled water company in Canada a position it still holds nearly 20 years later.<br>
<br>
The business was a mess and it took us about two years to completely overhaul every aspect of the business: improving the marketing and branding, upgrading and consolidating bottling facilities, replacing hundreds of trucks in our fleet, developing proprietary computer systems, upgrading staffing. We inherited a collective agreement with the Teamsters who I found to be very business oriented and got along well with. We launched many initiatives including the export brand Northern Crystal, the CrystalGuard and CrystalClean programs and began the consolidation of the industry with nearly 20 acquisitions. We pushed the expansion of the Canadian Bottled Water Association to include companies from Halifax to Victoria of which I became President. We were a force and heavily involved with the International Bottled Water Association wining many of their awards for marketing and membership.<br>
<br>
Our success brought us to the attention of Groupe Danone, owner of the Evian brand, who bought out the Wilmots in 1994. We embarked on a significant expansion of our small package capabilities. Just as I was leaving we agreed to acquire my first bottled water company Laurentian Spring Valley, Inc. After a number of hilarious and ridiculous run-ins with our imperious French masters I went out to Vancouver for Christmas in 1995 and never returned. Today Aquaterra is run by my original partner and all around great guy Rich Stephens.</p>

    <p class="description">After success in the bottled water industry I wanted to try another industry. My good friend Dave Steele from U of C days introduced me to Bill Trimble and before long I was involved in the video industry. I expanded the company into film and video post production for commercials, TV series and movies hoping to catch the move to Hollywood North. <br>
<br>
It was a time of great upheavel in the post production industry with the move from million dollar editing suites that took up several rooms to $50,000 Silicon Graphics workstations. Plus the new editing software had dramatically more capabilities than the old hardware. Telepost invested heavily in the new technologies as I was very comfortable with them from using them at the bottled water companies. We became a strong player but I could not achieve the profitability necessary to sustain a seemingly endless need to upgrade to the latest and greatest technology. I grew tired of being unable to pay for the last &quot;must have&quot; piece of editing equipment before having to buy the next one. Steven McDonald took over and still runs it almost 20 years later.</p>

    <p class="description">Richard Stephens, Paul Sansom and I co-founded Spring Valley Water Corporation in 1986 in Toronto. Our focus was on the water cooler and reusable five gallon (18 liter) market. A good buddy from Calgary, Chris Davis, had introduced Rich and I a few years earlier and we had spent several years looking for a business to start together. Paul exited quickly and Rich and I became partners in what we both remember as the most fun we have ever had in our business careers. Through innovation, agressive marketing, significant use of technology and general &quot;balls-to-the-walls&quot; strategy we quickly established Spring Valley as a leader in the Canadian bottled water industry. Our white trucks with the distinctive blue and white logo were everywhere, especially parked outside the Madison Avenue pub and Whistling Oyster restaurant with the flasers on. <br>
<br>
In 1987 we merged with out 100 year old competitor Laurentian and became the second largest Canadian company. Laurentian operated in Montreal so we started spending a lot of time in that wonderful city. Laurentian had an amazing group of shareholders led by the wonderful Storrs McCall. To our surprise they handed Rich and I the keys to the merged company and we sucessfully navigated the company to profitability a year later. In 1989 I was bored and the success of the merger enabled me to fulfill a lifelong dream and move out to Vancouver, BC. At that time I was sure that my career in the bottled water industry was over.</p>
