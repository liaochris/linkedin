      <p class="summary">

  </p>
    <p class="description">I'm Trend Micro's cloud computing and virtualization evangelist, responsible for thought leadership and strategy. I work with press, analysts, customers, partners, the Cloud Security Alliance, and the cloud and virtualization community in general to bring more cloud knowledge into Trend Micro, and to share Trend Micro's innovative new cloud and virtualization strategy. <br>
<br>
If you know me personally or look at my career history, you can tell I wouldn't have joined Trend Micro if I didn't actually find differentiated and interesting cloud (public and private) things happening here! I'm really excited. <br>
<br>
I blog about cloud security at http://cloudsecurity.trendmicro.com. You can also follow me at http://www.twitter.com/daveasprey where I tweet all of my blog postings, which are a mix of cloud and  virtualization and (when I have time) my personal blog, http://www.bulletproofexecutive.com.</p>

    <p class="description">Smart Life Forum is a non-profit 501(c)3 based in Palo Alto, with 135+ members who attend our monthly meeting on the 3rd Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm. See SmartLifeForum.org for details. <br>
<br>
Our members range from people wanting to get more life out of their years to highly sophisticated anti-aging and preventive wellness oriented laypeople and physicians. <br>
<br>
Each month, we provide a short forum for our members to raise questions or new findings on health, then invite leading experts in alternative health to present to our members, One of our advisors is a top-ranked antiaging physician (who runs antiaging.com) and another is the leading authority on cognitive enhancement (smart drugs). <br>
<br>
Past speakers include Aubrey de Grey (Cambridge-based creator of the SENS aging model), Julian Whitaker (chelation pioneer and author of &quot;Reversing Heart Disease&quot;), John Gray (Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus), Bruce Lipton (The Biology of Belief), and Bruce Ames (Berkeley mitochondrial aging expert).<br>
<br>
I'm 100% certain that Smart Life Forum has shared knowledge that has transformed the health of many people, and in some cases even saved lives.<br>
<br>
I've been a board member of Smart Life for several years, and now serve as President and Chairman.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">For larger companies, I do strategy consulting, in industries where I have deep domain expertise. Typical projects involve implementing usage based pricing, virtual appliance strategy, cloud strategy, WAN optimization,or market messaging. Clients have included publicly traded software companies and telecoms.<br>
<br>
For revenue-stage startups, I focus on target market, messaging, and business development strategy, and often write a white paper or two. I also conduct sales training  or speak at lead generation events. I recently trained all the salespeople for a division of a large telecom - the topic was how to understand and sell cloud computing.<br>
<br>
For pre-revenue startups, I help entrepreneurs translate what they do into venture-fundable presentations, then I help them connect with the right VC investors. There is usually also a good dose of strategy, marketing, and market segmentation in the mix. A recent client was a Kleiner Perkins backed startup, where I transformed the existing product into a cloud-connected service model.<br>
<br>
Clients are in mostly in the cloud, SaaS, virtualization, VDI, WAN optimization, networking, and health/wellness industries. I am very well networked at senior levels in these industries, and I bring this network to my clients.<br>
<br>
I am on the advisory boards of 3 prominent VCs and quite a few startups and I even sat on IBM's advisory board for a while.<br>
<br>
I am a (currently not investing) angel investor in tech startups. One of my recent investments was followed by Battery, Sierra, and Canaan, and others have been acquired by IBM and Sun.<br>
<br>
At this time, I am working with startups and VCs as a board member, advisor, or consultant. Open to equity-only arrangements for the right people.</p>

    <p class="description">I discovered this interesting company while I was an EIR at Trinity Ventures and agreed to co-found a US corporation which was to absorb a Canadian entity that had developed some IP around heart rate monitoring from the wrist. <br>
<br>
The goal was to create a consumer-focused cloud-based health and wellness service with social gaming mechanics to motivate behavior change around heart rate, exercise levels, amount of stress, quality of sleep, etc.<br>
<br>
I joined to focus on R&amp;D, technology operations, and strategy, but spent most of my time on venture fundraising.<br>
<br>
After several months of doing the Silicon Valley venture circuit, I learned an important lesson: you'd better have a LOT of capital if you want to launch a pre-revenue consumer hardware device that also relies on your own software and cloud-hosted systems, especially in a crowded space.</p>

    <p class="description">Completed Trinity's 3 month EIR program where I identified new areas of investment in cloud computing, virtualization, infrastructure, SaaS, etc. Met with early stage tech companies seeking venture funding, and networked with some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs and technologists with the potential to create the next big thing, now or later.<br>
<br>
EIR programs are particularly powerful because they let you see the inner workings of venture capital, making you that much more effective in fundraising and managing your board later. My thanks to Trinity for a very impactful experience!</p>

    <p class="description">I had 3 primary responsibilities at Blue Coat.<br>
<br>
I was Blue Coat's primary spokesperson and evangelist, working frequently with press and analysts, communicating and shaping technology strategy for Application Delivery Networking. Internally, I worked with product and engineering teams to take advantage of disruptive technologies like virtualization, cloud computing, and SaaS. I was one of the core team of 5 people who created Blue Coat's SaaS strategy.<br>
<br>
I lead the team responsible for all business development activities, including relationships with Microsoft, VMware, Brocade, Symantec, HP, Dell, Tandberg, Polycom, Adobe, RSA, etc., along with the broader Technology Integration Partner program. I grew the team to focus on the Blue Coat relationships with Oracle and SAP. In a recent quarter, my team was responsible for $6 million in co-selling, $5 million in reselling, and renegotiating royalties to save ~$1.25m. We generated more than $11,000 net revenue per hour spent on Business Development!<br>
<br>
I founded the Application Delivery Alliance to help F5, Cisco, Citrix, Brocade, Blue Coat and other companies reduce customer confusion around Application Delivery, expanding the market and reducing sales cycle time.<br>
<br>
I was also responsible for corporate development (M&amp;A) activities across the company, including creating and delivering M&amp;A business cases, performing diligence, and evaluating deals, both inbound from bankers, and outbound strategic opportunities.</p>

I also wrote the RFP for the first Corventis back-end software development project, a project worth &gt;$1m.
