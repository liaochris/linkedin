    <h2>Jason Hargrove&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        ==============================================<br>
<br>
+ + What I've Recently Done<br>
<br>
In 2007 I made a growth decision in which I would close my advertising company in Vancouver, BC to embark on a refinement of my career. The past three years were one part sabbatical, one part hard work, and one part incredible journey. I chose Toronto, ON as my base for this period.<br>
<br>
My focus project in Toronto was a technology framework that evolves user interfacing in desktop and mobile browsers. In early 2011 I'll release a great portion of my work to the open development and design community, as well as web services that allow non-developers to work with it. The primary service also allows experienced designers and developers expedite creation faster.<br>
<br>
+ + What My Focus is Today<br>
<br>
Using my focus technologies I am working on a number of standalone applications that I have sole equity in. These apps are varied in nature; generally influenced by my history in brand development as well as my interest in the Internet as a medium for collaboration.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile I'm digging in with projects that are bigger than myself. Through the end of January I'm in a heavy production rotation working on an application with a group of medical doctors based in Houston, TX. We're setting out to do our part to help push forward positive change in US Healthcare. Our work is based on, and extends, the focus technologies referenced above.<br>
<br>
Beyond this I'm accepting small projects that make use of my freelance services. I am well suited to work with venture-oriented startups who have a market-based glass ceiling they need to push through. I am available in the roles of Creative Director, Art Director and Senior Designer with specialization in brand strategy. I also bring a body of experience as a product-oriented Internet developer and of course am highly motivated to introduce and integrate my focus technologies where it makes sense.<br>

<br>
Notes: <br>
<br>
The weakest skills in the list mentioned above are the server-side technologies. The LAMP world was new to me when I started this process. As well, I've become a fairly advanced JavaScript programmer, which until this period I had only dabbled in. My years of experience working with Flash Actionscript aided me greatly. Today I view JavaScript as a paint brush. I'm most proud of my gains in this area.<br>
<br>
With innovative tools to aid me, I experienced a strong crystallization in my design talent. Having a dedicated project helped me focus and refine my creative style. As a result I feel I've done the best work of my life during this time. To be continued!</p>

Notes: <br>
<br>
Like many designers, I've been naturally working in brand for a long time. However, previous to Soulular, I was primarily sought after for web design being known for my interactive design and development. Over time my clients began to integrate the web-focused work I was doing into their overarching brand platform. Sometimes with my assistance, and sometimes not. In 2003 I formed a company to specialize in brand. While the economic drive of the company was still primarily coming from web production, I did quite well in brand strategy having had the privilege to work with some amazing people who helped me develop my expanded skillset. During this period of my career I worked with some great brand names and for three years was invited to be a judge and speaker at Simon Fraser University's &quot;Brand Wars&quot; inter-collegiate competition.</p>

Notes: <br>
<br>
Digital Dragon Media was a name derived of the fact I was on the winning Dragon Team in my Taekwondo school. In martial arts I brought a ferocity that was rarely matched in the ring or in class. I wanted to bring the same to my profession. And did I! Those were the early days of web and during this time I was caught up in a number of projects too large for me to rightfully take on. Unknown territory. This period of professional and personal development saw me go from amateur to professional to &quot;seasoned&quot; professional nearly overnight. I was fortunate to have a couple great mentors to show me how to open doors. And that's when I stepped through.  It was an exciting period that gave shape to the my future. I was fortunate to also have a chance to shape other people's futures too; something that would become a mainstay of my career.</p>

I arrived at WSI in Vancouver somewhat unintentionally. A few months earlier I was headhunted by a recruitment firm in Seattle, WA and hired at a company called Tattoo Media. I packed up my life in Edmonton and headed to the border with the documentation they provided. Unfortunately, it wasn't complete and I was turned around at the border. At the time I had a number of offers across North America, but I had become so excited about the West Coast that I ultimately chose WSI in Vancouver. And that's where I relocated to. Only a month into it I was taken into a little room and told that they were letting go of the entire company, except me and some production managers. The dot com bubble had burst and they decided I was strong enough to carry the weight on my own. I accepted the responsibility but realized I needed to build up a freelance roster in event of the company's complete collapse. It wasn't long before that happened and I started working for myself full time.</p>

I was headhunted by a recruitment firm in Seattle, WA to work at Tattoo Media which I recall was based in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. I packed up my life in Edmonton and headed to Vancouver with the documentation that the recruiting company provided. Unfortunately it turned out to be incomplete and I was turned around at the border. The recruiters wanted to attempt another crossing but I opted to take a job in Vancouver instead. I did take on some work remotely with Tattoo which went very well. Great people! While I never made it to Seattle and it was short lived, this job had a considerable impact on my life and career as it was initially the reason I had left Edmonton. The rest was history, as they say.</p>

Notes: <br>
<br>
In 1998 I was enrolled at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology studying computer sciences. I wasn't the greatest student, generally opting to work on my personal projects during class time. In the summer after my first year I was offered a couple jobs and the best of them was at SSI. It was originally intended to be just for a couple months, but ultimately it was opportunity that captured my attention and I never returned to NAIT. Though I had been freelancing through most of my teens, the work I received with SSI was my first truly professional experience. Previous to my arrival SSI was focused on hardware and so for the most part I was largely trailblazing my own path in the company. I learned many things, but primarily it was the management of clients that had the most profound effect on me. Great experience.</p>

Previous to 1996 I had worked with programs like Hypercard and Authorware to create interactive, web-like projects. In 1996 I learned HTML in high school and chose to pursue that as my primary creative expression. As a result I took on a couple part-time projects for pay and in exchange of services. My Taekwondo school was my first client and while it was classic 90's style web design, my work stood out and I began to get noticed. The Government of Alberta job was the first &quot;real&quot; project I had taken on. It was an intranet project for the Alberta health care industry called Alberta Wellnet. Coming off of that project I ended up securing a full-time job at a company called SSI. This would prove to be the start of my professional career.</p>

<br>
I had the great privilege of going to a new high school in Morinville, Alberta that was a test project for the reformation of public education. The school offered a new style of learning, and college level education in various fields. They also offered an incredible amount of technology and brought in industry leaders to teach. I made the school my home away from home, spending most evenings and many weekends working with the cutting edge tools they provided. I had a number of projects going on there, but Edge Tech Screening was my first true &quot;business&quot; project. I had a couple freelance workers, I had mentorship from the business teachers, and more importantly I had access to clients. It was amateur in scope &#x2013;&#xa0;but the work was real. And the experience was unparalleled. I was about 14 years old.</p>

Notes: <br>
<br>
I've had to revise the start date on this period. I visited Morinville recently and was told (reminded) that I had designed the logo for Morinville Community High School previous to it opening. I vaguely remember this, as I would have been about 11 years old, but it's been confirmed by a number of people. At this time, I wouldn't have been using a computer for illustration so I believe it was designed by hand and produced by another party. This officially puts my experience with brand at about 20 years. A little while later the school opened and I was contracted to illustrate prominent banners and signage for the building. I was also commissioned by various parties (including The Town) to produce pencil and watercolour artworks. These can be found hanging around Morinville to this day. An interesting start to my career - I intend to embark on a bit of professional archeology and collate more information about these early works.</p>
