    <h2>Mark Warnick&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        I have over twenty years of public safety service; sixteen years in a supervisory positions. I earned multiple certifications through the Emergency Management Institute (EMI). I have over 100 certifications in fire, EMS and emergency management. In my Bachelors Degree in Public Safety (specialization in Emergency Management) I have consistently achieved a 4.0 GPA with only one semester left, and plan to continue to PhD in the same. I am a current and upstanding member of Epsilon Pi Phi, the academic emergency management honor society. <br>
I am passionate about public safety, and think progressively. Always a very methodical pre-planner, I identify potential problems on the horizon. My attitude inspires individuals, families, businesses, and governments not only in preparedness and mitigation but also volunteerism. I have the innate ability to assess needs beneficial to the overall plan of preparedness, while still considering appropriate costs to get the job done with less financial hardship. <br>
I have successfully written Department of Homeland Security grants, and I served as a &#x201c;FIRE Act&#x201d; grant evaluator for four years. I founded and spearheaded a nation-wide granting charity that assisted fire and EMS agencies, and also consulted for the Department of Homeland Security. I have provided training and exercises from planning to presentation to a broad group of people from individuals to businesses and volunteers. I am equally effective in interaction with a new recruit, a sitting Governor, or even a Presidential Cabinet member. From an operational standpoint, I am comfortable as the Incident Commander, a responder, or support staff. I am well versed in statistics and statistical reasoning, and risk assessments for a wide range of agencies, and have written white papers for levels of government.<br>
I am a well above average and battle proven candidate who has a track record of success and received commendation as highly qualified for federal jobs in Emergency Management.

    <p class="description">Consulting with those who need advice in my areas of expertise, including Homeland Security, Emergency Management, Fire/Rescue, and EMS. Typically the consultation is with investors or a possible investor about the usefulness of new and upcoming technologies. Occasionally this would entail meeting with Wall Street analysts, describing the future of trends in public safety, and how the proposed product might fare in this emergent market.</p>

    <p class="description">Purchasing, marketing, and sales for Dalmatian Fire Equipment. Purchased $20,000-$60,000 per month of raw material and parts. Occasionally purchased in excess of $75,000 per month. Through negotiations on a case by case by case basis, lowered the cost per unit by an average of 58%. In the sales department, had personal sales in excess of $1 million per year. Consulted with fire departments, emergency management agencies and rescue squads to assist them in what equipment they needed versus what equipment they wanted, and how to get those products for a fraction of the cost. This would result in better equipping themselves at an optimum cost. I would also help agencies in grant writing, dealing with city councils and county governments, pre-planning and mitigating for disaster, at no charge. I was also North American (U.S. Canada and Mexico) Sales Manager with total annual North American sales exceeding $4 million. Personally was responsible for approximately $800,000 in sales during a 10 month period. Consulted with fire departments, emergency management agencies and rescue squads to assist them in what equipment they needed versus what they wanted, and how to get those products for a fraction of the cost. This would result in better equipping themselves at an optimum cost.</p>

    <p class="description">Consultant to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Energy (DOE) joint effort of Homeland Defense Equipment Reuse Program (HDER) with government Program Managers. Designed and formulated forms to help determine the most effective placement of equipment in relationship to Homeland Security in line with Presidential Directives, as well as being a key player in the determination of where the program would place equipment to better improve homeland security. I also designed and was working with HDER to implement several changes at the federal level to better prepare first responders for natural disasters, terrorist acts and other incidents, mostly through equipment placement and programs I proposed. I designed and worked in conjunction with AFG Grant specialists to encourage donations of equipment to the HDER program when fire departments and EMS squads received grants to replace equipment. Was a guest speaker in 2006 at Gov Sec in Washington DC for the HDER program. Occasionally, would be required to provide white papers on specific subjects, so others could have a better understanding of problems, and possible solutions. Facilitated or assisted in facilitating over $40 million of equipment to high risk areas (at no charge to the receiving organization).</p>

    <p class="description">Helping Our Own was a $7 million per year charity that took excess fire and EMS equipment, refurbished it, and donated it to fire departments in the U.S. at no cost to the receiving department. I worked on a voluntary basis for a six and a half year period during which my direction provided $36 million (used value) of fire and EMS and emergency management equipment to over 850 fire departments in the United States. If purchased new, this would have cost the departments over $72 million to purchase new. In 2004 the organization was taken over by National Fire Safety Council (NFSC) as a project. I managed day to day operations of picking up, refurbishing and delivering equipment while NFSC handled all other aspects of the organization. This was the ultimate experience in the mitigation process because I also helped departments around the nation build disaster plans for their community and to prepare for disaster. During this time span, I also lobbied at the federal level regarding fire, EMS and Emergency Management issues.<br>
    Coordinated, spearheaded and was directly responsible for ensuring 130 tons of fire and EMS equipment reaching ravished fire departments during hurricane Katrina. In the first week, 30 tons of fire and EMS equipment put 6 fire departments back in service, and over the next 60 days I managed 4 strike teams that delivered over 130 tons of equipment to Gulf Coast departments. During this time, managed between a 20 and 60 person work force, 7 days per week. Was also responsible for successfully bringing to the attention of Members of Congress by writing white papers, including Prevention of Firefighter Fatalities, Liability of Donated Fire Equipment, Emergency Response to the Pentagon on 9/11, and Conditions of the Rural Fire Service in the United States.</p>

    <p class="description">Volunteered my time to educate legislators (normally congressmen). Issues included homeland security, firefighter issues, EMS issues and emergency management issues. I worked closely with many legislatures and gave congressional briefings on occasion. Assisted in writing twelve bills. All were introduced, two passed, and one has been submitted to congress every year for the last six years. Twice, when keynote speaker of a Congressional briefing, was introduced as &#x201c;The Nations Expert on Rural Fire Departments&#x201d;. Both briefings were to educate lawmakers of rural fire service, rescue squads and emergency management agencies.<br>
     Directly after 9/11 was invited to come to Washington and provide an evaluation of the response to the Pentagon for one Congressman. Was actually on site at the Pentagon for a short amount of time observing rescue and recovery efforts.</p>

    <p class="description">Total responsibility for a self sufficient, all natural farm that had a 1 acre garden, a 60 acre Cedar and Oak tree farm, and over 80 head of livestock. The farm used only used 5%-7% of electricity from outside sources because of solar panels and woodstove heating. I also custom baled hay for over 30 different farms with a propane tractor. This was pursued and run in case Y2K ended up being a problem. This time of self sufficiency was probably one of the most enlightening periods in my life and it helped enlighten me in my emergency management career</p>

    <p class="description">For both organizations I was primarily responsible training first responders and for planning and putting together two large scale exercises every year that involved all Emergency Services (Law Enforcement, Fire Departments, EMS, health department and others). It was extremely important to make the exercises challenging and truly possible. In training I taught core classes such as HazMat Awareness, Incident Command System, Incident Management, Animals in Disaster, Grant Writing and much more. I was also responsible for recruiting and training businesses and individuals how to prepare for disaster, sometimes in conjunction with other organizations such as the American Red Cross or Ozark Action and civic organizations. This often included joint efforts with other counties and cities, including one county in another state.<br>
I was responsible for the annual hazard and risk analysis, and for proposing changes in the Emergency Operations Plans as well providing the statistics needed to influence the decision making process of the LEPC and Emergency Management Agency. I regularly presented findings to county managers and to the general public.<br>
I was an integral part of an overall team, and was a team player in all aspects. In the absence of the Director and Deputy Director, I was third in command. Often during a disaster, we would work in 12 hour shifts, with the Deputy Director and Director taking one shift (as the Emergency Management contingent of a unified command), and myself taking the other. I personally initiated a mitigation and pre-plan for disabled persons and pet evacuation and sheltering in conjunction with the evacuation of citizens.  Was the first person to ever facilitate exercises in this county and held five in five years. <br>
Note: In 2003 the County Commission decided to turn the responsibility over to the Sheriffs department in a money saving effort.</p>
