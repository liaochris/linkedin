          <h2>Matthew Loew&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I currently lead application engineering, technical marketing and customer service activities for Comet Solutions, a software development company that provides solutions that accelerate innovation by enabling product simulation and simulation driven design. In joining Comet, I bring to my role over 10 years direct customer experience in multidisciplinary engineering analysis and design. <br>
<br>
I joined Comet Solutions from Stewart &amp; Stevenson Vehicle Services, Inc. (now part of Armor Holdings), where I led modeling and simulation-based projects and drove efforts to initiate a systems engineering approach for the design of future vehicle platforms to aggressive performance specifications. My engineering career has had me responsible for project planning and execution for engineering-based CAD models, vehicle dynamics simulations, advanced powertrain simulations, and strategic supplier relationships. I was previously employed in the automotive industry by a Tier 1 chassis component manufacturer as both an engineering analyst and a project engineer and by a small cutting-edge research and development company focused on advanced, light-weight structures and components as a project engineer.<br>
<br>
I am a frequent presenter at PTC/User (5 years straight!) and serve on their Simulation and Behavioral Modeling Technical Committee. I also frequent the Eng-Tips engineering forum (www.eng-tips.com) and MCADCentral (www.mcadcentral.com). I do a lot of snooping through my network on this site as well.<br>
<br>
One of my life's goals is to participate in the Dakar Rally. This is a grueling 3-week event that starts in Europe, treks across North East Africa, into the Sahara, and ultimately finishes in Dakar, Senegal's capital. I have been a fan since I was a child.<br>
<br>
I am always trying to connect with others that have similar goals and experiences. Feel free to send me an invitation (matthewloew @ gmail dot com).

Comet gives design engineering workgroups the software tools to transform their product engineering process by enabling early simulation. No more waiting around for CAD before simulation work can begin, no more tedious manual translations and data re-entry, and no more multiple engineering models that must be rebuilt with each concept change. Comet's breakthrough Abstract Modeling capability allows your specialists to capture multi-disciplinary model and process expertise in simulation templates that non-experts can then easily use. Whether you are a designer, an analyst or a manager, Comet provides you with significant benefits so your company can move from the old &quot;build and break&quot; approach to &quot;got it right the first time&quot; through early simulation.</p>
