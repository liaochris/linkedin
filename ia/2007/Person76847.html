            <p>Hi I am Satya. I have always been excited about Animation. Although I come from a very traditional artistic family, by the time I was 13 I felt sure that animation was the best thing that ever happened to me. The desire to animate guided my studies at the National Institute of Design. I achieved distinction when my design concepts were selected for an international contest and I was invited to present them along with 15 other students from MIT and Royal College of Arts (London) at Amsterdam, Netherlands. Eventually I went to work in the research division of Lego Toys, UK where I was exposed to the world of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics. These experiences proved invaluable when joined Disney Imagineering in Burbank California, where I worked with some of the foremost creators of animation robotics on earth. Later I shifted base to Australia, where I worked for Fire Fly entertainment doing Effects work on projects like The Scorpion King, Lord Of The Rings and Blade-II. In 2004 I served as Head of Animation and Media Services at Nipuna Services Limited, which is the BPO subsidiary of Satyam, a 600m$ NASDAQ listed firm. During this time I directed quite a number of pilots and demo works for various companies, including Eden Games, which produced &#x201c;Need for speed&#x201d; 2&amp;3. I have subsequently spearheaded some game design projects from Singapore as well as a music video, which is yet to be released. Before joining Nipuna, I was the CCO of Applied Gravity, a New Zealand based company, which out sources 90% of work to Indian studios. My core strengths are special fx, digital media, 3D animation and animatronics.<br>
