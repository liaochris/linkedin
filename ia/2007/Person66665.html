          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Paul Lomax&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I've been developing websites since 1999 and created IPC's web technology department in 2003. I brought them Open Source, conceived the in-house content management system, launched 60 websites, and developed applications that are now business critical. I've done this with literally no budget at times and with big budgets at other times. But the technology has always been a means to an ends, and it's been the business side that's really driven me - I'm an entrepreneur at heart. <br>
<br>
I had been seeking a new challenge, something a bit different, and I've been given the perfect new opportunity at IPC. I've jumped into a Digital Publishing role and I will be working on Special Projects in the Connect (Women's Weeklies) division, where I will be reporting to the Managing Director.</p>

IPC Media is a Time Warner company and a wholy owned subsidary of Time Inc.<br>
<br>
Myself and my team were responsible for all the online technology such as the in-house content management system, application and website development, the systems administration, operations production and design, and ad traffic management.  <br>
<br>
I formed the department in 2003 with just three staff and six websites. Since then the team and the number of websites have doubled every year, which has been quite a challenge. <br>
<br>
Having built up the team from nothing and personally recruited almost everybody there, it was a very difficult decision to leave, especially given the exciting and ambitious development plans ahead in 2007. But after four years in the same role I needed a new and very different challenge.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Technical Systems Manager</h3>      <p><strong>IPC Media Ltd</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1001-5000 employees; TWX; Publishing industry)</p>  <p>            October 2001         &#8211; September 2002        (1 year)        </p>      <p class="desc">Following the collapse of the dotcom bubble and IPC's purchase by AOL Time Warner, I developed the technical architecture for two of IPC's digital key brands, NME.com and YBW.com, specifically porting NME to open source technologies, to ensure their survival during difficult market conditions.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Senior Solutions Developer</h3>      <p><strong>IPC Electric Ltd</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1001-5000 employees; Online Media industry)</p>  <p>            April 2001         &#8211; October 2001        (7 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Brought into IPC Media's online division to manage and develop all the UNIX, PHP and Perl solutions.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Managing Director</h3>      <p><strong>Max Internet Ltd</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Internet industry)</p>  <p>            September 1998         &#8211; March 2001        (2 years 7 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Max Internet was a web development, design and hosting agency, mainly trading under the DiscountDomains brand with a peak turnover of &#xa3;250k pa and over 10,000 customers. DiscountDomains was the first website in the world to sell a domain name for less than $80 direct to the consumer, taking advantage of deregulation and sparking a price war that saw the cost of domains drop to just $10 per year.<br>
<br>
An office was established in Manchester late in 1999, co-inciding with limited company registration. Prior to this I had ran the company part-time as a sole trader whilst studying at University. My role as MD was customer-facing and hands-on, involving business development, account management, project management of freelance designers and developers, management of support and administration staff and of course managing the finances.<br>
<br>
Following difficult trading conditions in 2001, the brand and customer base were sold, and the company put into liquidation prior to my move to London.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>IRCd Server Administrator</h3>      <p><strong>INS / Cable &amp; Wireless</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Internet industry)</p>  <p>            January 1999         &#8211; January 2001        (2 years 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">For a number of years I ran the Internet Relay Chat server known as irc.ins.net.uk for INS, which was a wholy owned subsidary of Cable &amp; Wireless.
