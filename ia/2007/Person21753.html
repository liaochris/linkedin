    <p class="description">As Vice President of Development for Packard Bell NEC's User Interface Division (formed by acquisition of Ark Interface), I was the principal software architect of their well-known product offerings, including Packard Bell Navigator, CallCenter, and Planet Oasis.  Our products shipped on more than 50 million machines in 5 years, in 28 languages on 6 continents, selling in retail outlets worldwide and bundled on 3 major OEM brands.  Packard Bell NEC (and Ark Interface) products were compatible with all Windows platforms, and were designed to include the most cutting-edge technologies:  COM/DCOM models, SAPI-compliant voice recognition and text-to-speech, TAPI support, XML communications, and transparent Internet connectivity. My role as Vice President of Development included research into new technology and product ideas; from developing new ideas through relationships with other organizations to creating and prototyping new ideas in our labs.</p>

    <p class="description">In my roles as Chief Engineer and Vice President of Development, I was the principal architect of Ark Interface's well-known product lines.  Brand-specific products, such as Ark Workspace, Ark Kidspace, Packard Bell Navigator, Epson FocalPoint, and NEC's Kidspace and Deskspace took full advantage of the power and technology available in modern personal computer systems.  Ark's retail products were highly successful in the market, in part due to the rigorous compatibility testing they received prior to release.  Using C++ and basing the products on a strict set of objects and object management primitives greatly enhanced and simplified the platform transportability and localization efforts.  After acquisition by Packard Bell Corporation, I built the small design and development team into a world-class development division.  In my role as Vice President I organized the development operations strategy and built key corporate partnerships. Acquired by Packard Bell NEC in April 2004.</p>

    <p class="description">I designed and developed Scott & Scott's power engineering products, including Distribution Primary Analysis and Graphics (DPA/G), Contingency Analysis, and Optimal Switching Analysis:  a family of interactive products designed for engineers to be used for short- and long-range planning, design, simulation and operation studies of electrical distribution systems. These highly graphical products were developed on the PC using Microsoft Windows and subsequently ported to the Unix platform. In my role creating the Advanced Technologies division, I established the company's first research organization, developing new products and expanding the existing product line onto new, high-end platforms such as IBM's RISC 6000 series and InterGraph's workstations. These new products were designed and developed to create a real-time interactive electrical distribution analysis system networking Unix/Motif and Microsoft Windows products with SCADA systems.</p>

    <p class="description">As a Research Scientist on the SPICE and Mach research and development teams I designed and developed components of the user interface, process control, and screen manager and their subsequent port into the Mach operating environment.  <br>
The SPICE project, renamed the Mach Project in 1986, is widely considered the core design foundation of Microsoft's NT-based operating systems (Windows 2000 and Windows XP) as well as the basis of the Next computer.<br>
Working with the Robotics Institute and the Library of Congress, I developed the encryption and compression routines for the Universal Library Project to provide Internet access to paper-based books and periodicals and other authored works.</p>
