    <p class="description">My mortgage industry experience and expertise was put to the test in this position.<br>
<br>
In sixty days I learned over twenty conforming, jumbo, and Alt-A products.  My job was to take 8-16 calls per hour from mortgage brokers, listen to their scenario including ltv / cltv, credit score, documentation type, and other factors, ask appropriate questions, and find the best-fit 2-3 products from our portfolio.  I then discussed which product had the best pricing and which product would take the least amount of time to approve (least conditions).<br>
<br>
The Regional Sales Manager utilized the very little time available off the phone to track down problems, monitor profit and loss statements including adjusting pricing at the branch level for incentives and mark-up, and assist sales with training sessions in new and changed products.</p>

    <p class="description">Pre-Paid Legal has been an incredible education.  It's my first business and I have failed time and time again but the experience has been invaluable.  I've learned it's more important to fail and keep going than to succeed and become complacent.  Take risks and keep thinking larger to get what you truly want.  I earned my "general business acumen" of how the economy, industry, and business works; something business school does not teach.  <br>
<br>
I associated myself with some of the finest people in the world committed to making a difference in their life and the lives of others.  I am now of the opinion that business is truly the way to help people.  You can help a lot more people with money than without!  And a successful business that produces profits is a sustainable organization meaning the good work can continue.</p>

HSBC teams focused on two core philosophies -- individual experts and MOS.<br>
<br>
Findings:<br>
The success of each team was dependent almost entirely on leadership.  The model used within each team was not an indicator of performance.  The top two producing teams each used one of the models.  It was the individual managers "buying-in" to the model, staffing and training their team appropriately, and driving performance that mattered most.</p>

    <p class="description">Company of Friends (CoF) is the Fast Company magazine network of readers.  I was very enlightened by their meetings on topics of entrepreneurship, what it means to be a global citizen, and branding.  I still consider Fast Company to be a leading publication focused on what is important in business and in the world.<br>
<br>
I was looking for a job at the time along with several other members.  My experience in Chicago taught me well in interviewing, networking, and other job seeking and professional advancement skills so I started the Job Seekers Network to share what I had learned and help advance myself by advancing others.  <br>
<br>
We met on a regular basis and companies began sending job postings to me to post to the group.  One such company was the Hired Guns, a marketing firm out of New York City.  I applied for this job and became a marketing rep on Amtrak trains!</p>

    <p class="description">The technology industry was in a recession in 2001.  I did what I had to do and took whatever work was available.<br>
<br>
In December 2003 I was asked to work one day as a receptionist at Flagstar Bank while he took a vacation day.  Two weeks later the receptionist was promoted to customer service and I was asked to come back for a long-term assignment which lasted the next eight months and promoted me into closing and customer service!</p>

    <p class="description">I worked through the marketing firm Hired Guns to promote a joint venture by Compaq, Yahoo, and Amtrak to provide wireless internet access using hand held devices on board commuter trains.<br>
<br>
I interacted with the general public in showing them the Compaq devices and how they could check email while wearing bright purple Yahoo attire.  It was a great opportunity to field lots of questions and see the different points of view of each business traveler and even kids interested in playing with the "toys".</p>

    <p class="description">Motorola provided outplacement services through DBM.  DBM taught me interviewing, networking, resume prep, and other vital skills.  Chad Coe came into our offices one day to teach effective personal networking to find work and offered to meet with us in his office.  <br>
<br>
I saw how teaching classes is a very effective strategy for attracting new clients.  Several people took him up on his offer.  He never pressured anyone to buy and only spoke one or two sentences on his services.  He focused on helping people first!<br>
<br>
I met with Mr. Coe in his office where he provided a several key contacts for my job search.  In speaking with me he must have seen something I did not see in myself at the time for he invited to numerous exclusive events including the Gray Hair Network and small business networking events.  He recommended several times to think about starting my own business which in subsequent years I did!<br>
<br>
I will always be thankful for the education I received because of Chad Coe.</p>

    <p class="description">Much of my senior work with Osman Balci at Virginia Tech concerned Software Testing.  He considered it a critical part of any software development project and so do I!  In returning to Olympus Group for a second summer I could think of nothing better than to implement all of the testing methods I had learned.<br>
<br>
I constructed a test harness published to our internal web site with red and green lights indicating the status of each software component.  This uncovered multiple problems and was a great resource to developers whom could see instantly if their changes in one component affected another.</p>
