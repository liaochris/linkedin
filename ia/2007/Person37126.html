    <p class="description">I am fairly new to the Marketing arena and that is why this position excites me so much.  As you can tell from most of the other positions held they are exciting but they are the same.  I am currently working under Todd Herschberg the director of marketing here at Wild Attire, Inc., and trying to learn everything he can offer.  Currently my focus is on managing our affiliate programs and attempting to keep the ones that do the business happy.  As I am still assisting the CEO/President with the day to day operations and slowly handing over the Human Resources duties the move into marketing has been a slow one but I am really looking forward to more responsibilities in the very near future!</p>

    <p class="description">After finishing up at quepasa.com I took some much needed time off.  Then during the “hmmm now what should I do” process there was a need in World Savings Loan Department for a loan processer.  I went in and spoke to them and walked out with a job.  I picked up the tasks of processing loans quickly and was very efficient, so they decided to teach me to sell the loans.  Within six months or so I was selling loans to walk in customers as well as processing mine and 3 other loan officer’s loans.  On top of that I was the “IT person” in the office since I was the only person working there that knew anything about computers, their workings and how to network them.  It was fun but a bit too slow paced than I was used to so when a position with Wild Attire came about I decided it would be a good move.<br>

We hired the best people we could get and went full speed ahead into the Bi-Lingual Search Engine Market.  I took part in the day to day operations in the company.  All employee benefits, payroll, accounting, you name it I did it.   We built this company up to 50 employees and jumped on the Internet IPO train in 1999.  At the time of the IPO I took part in investor relations.  I personally raised the 1st money to come into the company.  I not only had to prepare all employees for the scrutiny of an IPO I also took part in the dog and pony show, traveling from state to state, brokerage firm to brokerage firm selling an idea, answering questions and keeping investors relaxed yet excited at the same time.  It was quite an experience!!</p>
