    <p class="description">Co-founded a company to manufacture, market, and sell a unique boating too (Easy Threader).  This tool was unique to the market and required a great deal of user education.  I was responsible for taking the product from an idea to production, then marketing and selling it.  <br>
<br>
I ran advertisements in national boating and sailing magazines, created an e-commerce website, and sold the product via trade shows and through cold calls to distributors and retailers.<br>
<br>
The product was amazing, but the market was not large enough to sustain operation.  While the company was not profitable, it was an amazing experience an gave me insight into starting a new company.</p>
