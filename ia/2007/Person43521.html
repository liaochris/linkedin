              <p>&#x201c;We had a great month, almost a $1.5 million increase in sales! Have a great weekend! &#x2013; OfficeDepot.com<br>
<br>
&#x201c;The team at icrossing is an absolute pleasure to work with. Each member demonstrated their expertise in their individual fields, working together as a cohesive group, despite geographical differences. Project steps were completed ahead of deadline and the process for ARAC was made so simple that even an inexperienced Webmaster could easily implement their code. The results icrossing delivered were remarkable and exceeded all expectations.&#x201d; - ARAC.com<br>
<br>
&#x201c;I am impressed by icrossing&#x2019;s vision and knowledge of the search industry. Additionally, the model, largely performance-based, provides mutual benefits for both organizations. This way, icrossing shifts from being an agency to becoming a stakeholder who is involved in coming up with innovative solutions on a daily basis.&#x201d; &#x2013; Director of Internet Strategy Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts</p>
