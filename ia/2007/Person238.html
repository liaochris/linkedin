              <p class="summary">
                Always looking to foster relationships for the purpose of bringing solid entertainment investments to the attention of all funding sources thus creating a synergy that can lead to a good long term mutual benefiting relationship. <br>
As an example there is projects with the following. <br>
1) Film project-Budget is 10 Million-6 Million is already in place. <br>
2)Film project-Budget is 30 Million-18 Million in place <br>
3)Film project-Budget is 5.5 Million-750k is in place <br>
4) Music Project-Budget 100 Million-15% in place<br>
We are always looking to communicate with possible liquid(equitable) investors that would be interested in funding serious Film/TV/Music projects. <br>
The projects come with box office proven A-list Directors, as well as A-list talent. <br>
With crews(behind the scene staff) that has worked on projects that grossed over 100 Million at the box office. <br>
The various genre projects are packaged tight and make complete sense, and are ready to go. <br>
Films also can come in the form of slates with 10-50% funding already in place. <br>
Also some of the single projects come with 10-50% funding in place. <br>

    <p class="description">Many lenders only offer one or two loan programs with limited options. Borrowers often do not get the best financing solution or are constrained with terms that are inadequate because the lender is inflexible. Getting the "right" loan requires a lender with multiple program options and the willingness to be creative in its approach. With multiple alternatives available, Bond Street can customize each loan to meet the specific needs of the Borrower. <br>
<br>
We often find that the needs of the borrower may change during the loan process and the initial loan program selected is no longer the best loan for a particular borrower's needs. Bond Street often seamlessly moves loans between programs without any additional costs to the Borrower or loss of time. An additional Bond Street advantage.</p>
