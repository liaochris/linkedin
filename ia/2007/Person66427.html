          <h2>Paul Allen&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I am a serial social entrepreneur, trying to build businesses that improve the world and connect and strengthen families.<br>
<br>
I am best known for co-founding what is now called The Generations Network (formerly MyFamily.com). We launched the Ancestry.com website in 1996 and the fast-growing MyFamily.com web site in 1998. We started attracting millions of users. We brought in an executive management team that raised $90.5 million in venture capital. I moved from Utah to Silicon Valley during the bubble, and we attempted to take the company public.<br>
<br>
We survived the dot com bubble burst but after we became profitable I left in 2002 to start new companies. The company had decided to focus soley on genealogy while I thought the best strategy was to also provide free web sites for every family in the world.<br>
<br>
I left the company in February 2002, but have watched the company continue to grow. The company generated approximately $150 million in revenue in 2006.<br>
<br>
Like many founders, I did okay with this business, but not as well as I had hoped. As Ray Noorda of Novell fame once quipped, &quot;finders keepers, founders weepers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I enjoy starting companies that provide valuable content and communication tools that can improve the quality of life. I have been involved in electronic publishing since 1990, mainly in religious, educational and genealogical content.<br>
<br>
In 2006 I ran an internet incubator called Provo Labs that developed several startup companies and invested in others.<br>
<br>
In 2007 I have chosen to focus all my attention on the most promising company in our portfolio, World Vital Records. We have launched a new social network for family history called FamilyLink.com.<br>
<br>
My vision is to help families worldwide to use technology to connect to ancestors and living family members. I am trying to spend a week a month travelling in different countries working with archives, libraries, genealogy companies and publishers, who have significant family history content.

    <p class="description">Provo Labs is a seed stage fund and incubator. We seek to build internet businesses that will make the world a better place. Most of our concepts involve content and community.<br>
<br>
Using market research and competitive intelligence methodologies, we identify concepts which appear most promising. Then we form a prototyping team and provide initial funding for an early launch.<br>
<br>
When the web site is live, we use internet marketing tactics and guerilla marketing to generate significant traffic to the web site. Then we monitor key performance metrics to determine if the business model is viable.<br>
<br>
Once we have determined to fully back a startup company, we help identify investors and management for the new company. Provo Labs sometimes provides additional bridge capital to get the business on its feet.<br>
<br>
We are often willing to take a minority stake in our own companies, reserving a majority of the equity for the investors, management team and initial developers.</p>

    <p class="description">This was my start in the computer industry. I ran a $40,000 Kurzweil (OCR) scanner for my first few months. We scanned professional reference information for large publishing companies and for internal use.<br>
<br>
A few months into my job I was hired to do &quot;data preparation&quot; -- to build infobases for Folio's large publishing clients. I learned WordPerfect macros, Turbo Pascal, and Basic programming, as well as Folio's markup language (somewhat akin to SGML or HTML). I had some great mentors (thanks Rick Edwards, Steve Barwick and Lee Gibbons!)<br>
<br>
I especially loved using FSR, a GREP-like utility for doing massive search and replaces in huge files. (Written by Grant Beckman)<br>
<br>
During my last two years there I built dozens of huge (10-100+ megabyte) infobases for major legal and accounting publishers. I learned enough about electronic publishing to start out on my own.</p>
