              <p class="summary">
                I am a very outgoing, calm and detail oriented person who never stop thinking and hardly ever fails to achieve a target. I am extremely good in training people and implementing procedures into existing organizations as well as in developing new operations. As a natural leader I can build a harmonized homorganic team of people whom are testing and criticizing the people in the organization of which they are working for and yet not be treated as outsiders and are not alienated by the same people they are criticizing. I enjoy living in general and capture the little things. For my leisure I read,  exercise, travel and spend time with my immediate family.

    <p class="description">As the Cofounder and the Content Manager of the website I was directly involved in the design and implementation of a state of the art platform for managing web forums. Hydepark revolutionized the way forums were established and managed. Hydepark gave the users the power to start and manage their own forum with very limited computer knowledge. Forum managers have total decision making powers regarding their forum for as long as their decisions are not conflicting with the site rules and regulations.<br>
I was also in charge of the sites' advertising, PR, performance monitoring, sales and creating strategic partnerships with other websites. Hydepark success and popularity with over 250,000 active registered users lead to its sale to Venice Technologies Ltd, the operator of another Israeli very popular website hevre.co.il.</p>

    <p class="description">I put together and trained a team of 15 QA engineers to oversee development of all new products and test all existing products for bugs, network loading and potential security threats. As the founder of the department, I wrote the manual and created procedures for the department and the entire company. I developed new tools and software to perform the tasks at hand. I designed new testing systems and implemented state of the art Analog and Digital technologies used to improve performance of the company's software both on Clients and on Server operating environments. I was also in charge of identifying and negotiating the purchase of existing technologies to perform the task of Quality Assurance.<br>
Although I was not required to do so, I took it upon myself to educate the entire organization of the role and importance of the QA department.</p>

    <p class="description">Amicada was a technology Start Up that developed technology for interactive web advertising platforms. The company did not make it through the dot-com bubble burst at the beginning of the century. As the QA Manager of a Start Up I had to work with a limited number of employees and with limited technology due to lack of resources. As such, I had to improvise and develop new methods and systems to perform a much needed job. It was my responsibility to recruit and train a team of 6 engineers to perform a real time testing for all products so that the development team can identify and repair potential problems with the software.</p>

The company did not make it through the dot-com bubble burst at the beginning of the century. I started as full time outside consultant employed by Tescom and after a while Tescom transferred me to Broad Serve with my approval. During my employment at Broad Serve I was required to give lectures regarding Broad Serve technology and our QO methods to Strategic Partners in the US on top of recruiting and training 3 engineers. I implemented the QA system design provided by Tescom.</p>

I joined Tescom straight after earning my theoretical education in the software industry and immediately fall in love with Quality Assurance. I quickly discovered that I had the right personality for the task in hand. At Tescom I learned all there is to know about QA and from there I took it on my own to develop newer and better methods.</p>
