Expanding on the success of TRUEreq we purchased ProductSoft in early 2004, changed our name and expanded our focus from requirements management across the entire product lifecycle.  Mastering the art of delivering hosted process management solutions, such as PLM, we are now focusing on helping managers become more effective and have changed our name to Green Array.</p>

<br>
During my tenure as VP of Product Management I led the product management and engineering teams that delivered new iterations of six different collaboration tools in nine-month cycles.  During this time we also successfully patented and launched the online presence indicator PLINK.  As well, I was part of the team that successfully raised over $30M in venture capital funding.

    <p class="description">Fortunecity.com is a leading web hosting, tools and online community network.  Founded in the United Kingdom in 1997, The Fortunecity Network grew to being one of the worlds largest web hosting providers and the 11th most visited site on the Web by 2000.  Fortunecity had a successful IPO in March 1999.<br>
<br>
When I joined Fortunecity in 1997 it had already become the 200th most visited site on the Web by leveraging the network of its citizens.  The appeal was the opportunity to harness that growth and retention engine into a profitable business.  As director of operations I oversaw product development, engineering, member acquisition and retention as well as facilities and asset management.  During my time as director of operations we opened operations in seven different countries (including; Sweden, Italy, Spain, Germany and Japan) while growing to being the 26th largest property on the Internet.</p>

    <p class="description">Flycast Communications was a pioneer in Internet advertising.  Flycast eventually grew to being a network on over 1,000 websites auctioning advertising space.  Flycast Communications had a successful IPO in June 1999.  Subsequently, Flycast was purchased in October of 1999 by CMGI and merged with Engage.   <br>
<br>
Internet advertising was in its infancy when I joined Flycast in 1996.  There were no standard banner sizes and there was no market for web advertising.  The challenge was to compliment a real-time ad serving technology with a set of tools that would enable buyers and sellers of advertising to utilize this technology.  As a part of the product management team we launched five web advertising buying and selling tools.  In my role as marketing manager I was a part of the initial market launch and two subsequent corporate identity and customer acquisition campaigns.  I am proud to have been a significant part of this important time and segment of the Internet&#x92;s growth.</p>
