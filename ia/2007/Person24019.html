    <p class="description">This is really just a fun tidbit about me... I was an aspiring child actor in Los Angeles, growing up. I appeared in a guest star role on "Golden Girls", a couple of print ads, and a student film. Aside from my brief moment in the spotlight, I had some really big near successes... I interviewed with Steven Spielberg personally for the role of Rufus in "Hook" and in fact had the part, until the other kid that actually got it popped up at the last minute. They even fitted me for wardrobe! Oh well. Another similar near success was "Lord of the Flies", the final audition for the role of Ralph came down to myself and Balthazar Getty, who ultimately beat me for the part. Eventually acting just became too much of a time commitment... I decided to bail out and focus on school just as my acting career was really starting to heat up. I don't regret it one bit... but who knows where I'd be today if I hadn't stopped??? :)</p>
