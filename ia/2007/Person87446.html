          <h2>Travis Tremain&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I began my career as an Engineering Graduate constructing large mine site processing plants as an integral part of a team based in remote locations.<br>
<br>
After a year I relocated back to Perth where I took on a project management role completing state and local government contracts up to $4,000,000 dollars in value in and around the local region.<br>
<br>
I have since relocated to Sydney, Australia where I am currently deploying my skills with Imagine Un Limited in many facets of business development such as marketing, branding, operations and training. I began as a Licensee with Imagine, &#x2018;on the tools&#x2019; so to speak, and I have since worked my way through the ranks to become apart of the Imagine management team in several locations around Australia; Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.<br>
<br>
I am looking for opportunities to develop the business I am passionate for, Imagine from all corners of the globe. I am also looking for ways I can create value for others. Looking for people to connect with for mutual benefits.<br>
