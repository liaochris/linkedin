            <h2>Kim Flintoff&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have taught in the Creative Industries Faculty of the Queensland University of Technology where I'm also working on a PhD (Developing a model for Process Drama using networked technologies). Since 2006 I'm working in WA again, and have been teaching in Contemporary Performance at Edith Cowan University. <br>
<br>
I've been developing expert knowledge in the field of practice-led research and have authored an online teaching module on the topic for the Australian Technology Network of Universities.  I'm a regular contributor to the Digital Chalkie, and was a peer reviewer for the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (2005-2006).  My current research sees me using Second Life, the amazing avatar world developed by Linden Lab.<br>
<br>
I taught Drama at Rossmoyne SHS and John Forrest SHS, lectured in Drama Education at ECU. I have extensive background in theatre production. While currently examining the implications of technology and virtual domains in educational Drama, I'm also interested in NLP, brain-based and accelerated learning applications, student-centered and co-operative learning.<br>
<br>
I'm co-founder and former chair of Class Act Theatre (Theatre-in-Education) and founder and present chair of SHY (Seen and Heard Youth). I was Director of Technology for Drama Australia and was the first Technology Officer of DramaWest (1996-2001). In 2001, I co-chaired a Special Interest Group “Drama and New Media” at the IDEA2001 (International Drama/Theatre and Education Association) World Congress held in Bergen, Norway and at IDEA2004 in Ottawa, Canada.<br>
<br>
A regular presenter at local, national and international conferences, I also run a range of Drama Education websites (http://drama-education.com) and discussion groups on the internet; DramaPlayShop (http://sig7.org). Additionally, I was a Curriculum Council Drama Moderator, member of MindMatters WA Working Party, member of Black Swan Theatre’s education group and a part-time web designer.

<br>

Kim Flintoff (Kim Pasternak), Edith Cowan University<br>
<br>
Theatrical spaces have historically been places used to teach, purge and shape culture. For over a decade, virtual reality has offered a new kind of theatrical space; now, with the rise of social networking spaces, many more people are using the potential of the web to perform, critique and comment on cultural issues. Second Life provides a new and exciting space where students can explore issues that are both personal and global in significance. This session will involve participants in role-playing, reflection and discussion. Participants will also be encouraged to brainstorm the possibilities of incorporating such strategies into their own educational programs.</p>
