          <h2>AARON HOOLEY&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I consider myself to be a multi-talented business developer with strong emphasis placed on sales and marketing. With ten years experience in various aspects of developing or administering marketing tools and strategy, and with eight years experience in selling either finance or information technology services to C-Level Executives, I bring a unique perspective to customer acquisition, management, and retention. <br>
<br>
I pride myself on the passion I attach to a business development project, and then tenaciously seeing the project through to a successful end. The strength behind my sales skills comes from the &quot;Hunter&quot; mentality, but with all the depth of &#x201c;Customer Service First&#x201d;. Because of this, I&#x2019;ve been fortunate enough to develop some great client relationships, some of which present professional references on Linked In, and which continue to be fruitful to this day.<br>
<br>
I am using Linked In to maintain current contacts and develop new contacts for the purposes of networking to help others. Secondly, in obtaining new clients in my current business, and lastly to stay proactive about both keeping an eye out for profitable business ventures and/or moving up in my career.

    <p class="description">Marquette Equipment Finance, a subsidiary of Meridian Bank, N.A. and part of Marquette Financial Companies, a private company with $2.4 Billion in assets and equity capital in excess of $400 Million. Our ownership structure provides clients with increased access to both a lower cost of funds and financial products that encompass both sides of the balance sheet. As part of Meridian Bank we operate within the high standards of a regulatory banking environment. Our niche product is focused on technology initiatives that involve Software deployment, Hardware upgrades, or Soft Costs attributed to vendor consulting fees, installation, and service agreements.<br>
<br>
I like helping C-Level Executives find alternative ways to buy equipment at a cost savings they may not have been aware of prior to my call.  I'm most successful with funding Technology Initiatives that involve leasing of Software and IT Services that would otherwise be purchased with cash or not have been budget-approved at all.</p>

    <p class="description">Since 1980, PC Training West enjoyed a successful Utah market share of training consumers in computer and network certifications. A strategic alliance with the University of Utah AOCE program accelerated its growth, prompting investment in facilities outside Utah, and acquisition of another successful Utah training company &#x2013; Thin Blue Edge. This rebranding effort focused on corporate sales of training in desktop software, and technologies from Cisco, Java Programming, Linux Security, and as an Oracle Authorized Education Center.<br>
<br>
What I liked about working here was the opportunity to do something creative in business. My success selling at New Horizons helped me develop new corporate marketing strategies such as the new website, strategic alliances with Utah companies, and new market expansion. My success here was attributed to decreasing Operations expenses, building the Corporate Sales Team, and successfully rebranding the Thin Blue Edge name under the PC Training West reputation.</p>

    <p class="description">Since 1982, New Horizons has become the largest independent IT training company worldwide. As a single source for all corporate IT training, its customized enterprise solutions allow corporate executives to easily administer learning programs and track employee progress. Use of an Integrated Learning approach to training combines classroom and eLearning products and services to create the most effective learning experience available. It provides a wide selection of desktop training and technical classes focused on technologies from Cisco, Linux, Macromedia, Microsoft, Novell, and certifications in network security and software development.<br>
<br>
I was Number One ranked salesperson in the company! Opportunities in account expansion with multiple decision makers made my job fun. My greatest success was closing the bulk of the company&#x2019;s key accounts in Government &amp; Higher Education, and then making a critical shift to closing larger key Enterprise accounts.</p>

    <p class="description">Golden Gate Financial, LLC was partner operated with a marketing mission of helping clients &#x201c;Building Bridges to a Better Financial Future&#x201d;.  Established with multiple sub-prime lending sources, it was niche focused on loan products that helped borrowers who needed a poor credit home purchase, a heavy debt load consolidation, or a credit repair solution.  Customer service philosophies supported by the small team of Mortgage Sales Associates were centered on value-added service such as consumer credit education, income budget development, and bridge loan finance strategies.<br>
<br>
As one of two partners in this small business I liked the creative and control aspects of growing multiple aspects of my company  &#x2013; marketing, financial planning, customer retention, loan officer development, etc. We were most successful with customer acquisition programs that generated repeat or referral business, and in implementing our value added services in financial education and credit repair.</p>

    <p class="description">Ross Hospital, a privately held corporation in Kentfield, California, administered inpatient nursing care programs for adults with critical psychiatric or chemical dependency symptoms. It also ran one of the only inpatient children and adolescent programs in the State of California, and the only hearing-impaired psychiatric program on the entire West Coast.<br>
<br>
Participating in both the Hospital Marketing Committee and contract negotiations for MediCal insurance services is how I made the transition from nursing to business. What made me most successful were my work ethic, and initiative to develop business solutions that had a positive impact on nursing care. This earned me a management role as the youngest nursing professional on the team, and the ability to supervise shift operations even when per diem RN&#x2019;s were technically supposed to be running the show.</p>
