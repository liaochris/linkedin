              <p class="summary">
                Our company has successfully produced over 750 sales and marketing programs for clients in the Southeastern US and the United Kingdom. We have extensive experience with early stage and rapidly growing companies in several industries including software, hardware and life science.<br>
<br>
Maverick was deveveloped to offer companies strategic marketing and sales operations services that need results, but don't need full-time employees. We were recognized as a market leader in 2004 by our selection to Seth Godin's Bull Market Directory of 400 companies globally that make things happen in a changing world.<br>
<br>
My goal for Maverick is not to be the largest consulting company or agency, but to be the best at what we do, the fastest at what we do and the most effective at what we do.<br>
<br>
I am also serving on the Grants Board for NC IDEA (www.ncidea.org) as an advisor to the fund's management. The Grants Board evaluates very early stage companies for grant funding as assistance to help them get to seed or series A funding.<br>
<br>
When I'm not working, I am either having fun with my very signficant other and 3 soon to be 5 kids. I also try to recapture my youth as a soccer goalie in a recreation league and pretend to be Lance Armstrong on my bike.

    <p class="description">I was the Chief Marketing Officer and one of the founders of a company that was developing multi-lingual e-learning content and software. We had operations in Raleigh-Durham and Sao Paulo Brazil. The technology and concept were very cool, but the funding environment was horrific. I enjoyed learning about conducting business in Latin and South America during this adventure.</p>

  <p class="organization-details">(Privately Held; 11-50 employees; Computer Software industry)</p>
  <p class="period">
    
        <abbr class="dtstart" title="1999-12-01">December 1999</abbr>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">I was the Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Yellowbrick. This was a CRM sofware company that sought to connect all of a company's customer facing applications into a single platform, i.e. web, call center, order entry. The company worked very effectively in developing partners with every major CRM software company in the industry at that time. There was a tremendous buzz generated in the industry press and with the analyst community at the time of the launch also.<br>
<br>
The challenge came for my 4 field sales representatives when they talked to CIOs about the software in the fact that it could become the single point of failure for their customer facing apps. The length of the sales cycle was long enough it hindered the traction vs. funding needs of the company. Ultimately the company had challenges with funding to continue operations like all companies did in 2001.</p>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">My job was to work with channel VARs in the Carolinas to market and sell Oracle applications and database technology. This entailed acting as the de facto sales manager in some cases and as a supplemental sales resource in others. The position required helping the VARs with marketing and event planning. <br>
<br>
I was also responsible for selling directly to accounts not being sold by a national account team. My overall sales put me in the top 10 reps in the eastern US and in my last year and I acheived 192% of quota, which qualified me for the Presidents Club.</p>
