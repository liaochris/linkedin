            <h2>Henry Drury&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have been working in the automotive industry since 1992.<br>
I have held the responsibility of a general technician up to a senior manager. I have worked for several automotive shops in the Raleigh area. Several of these facilities have expressed great appreciation to me for helping them turn there business in to something more profitable and productive. Through the years of working in this business I've built many relationships with clients inside and out of this industry. My reputation as a knowledgeable, honest, and well respected individual in the automotive industry is well known. I have received many awards and certifications from independent automotive and management training companies. I have also received factory training from Bosch, Volkswagen, and BMW. I have fulfilled the retail store manager training requirements for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and have managed a profitable corporate owned Goodyear service department. I have also held the responsibility of general manager at a Goodyear Franchise in Cary, NC. Recently I went to the Midas Corp. Headquarters in Chicago to train and apply for a Midas Franchise license. I opened a new Midas store in downtown Cary NC for the owner of that property. It was a 6 month contract that I managed to fulfill in the determined amount of time. I am now currently selling new and pre-owned BMW automobiles at Performance BMW in Chapel Hill NC. Recently I have started a radio show via podcast! It's called "hank's garage". You can find it on WWW.talkshoe.com, once you get to the website just do a search for hanks garage and you can view details and download previous shows that were recorded live! It's basicly geared for the every day auto owner that may have questions or concerns. I answer questions and offer advice on various topics. Please check it out@!

    <p class="description">I am very excited about my new job! I am selling new and pre-owned BMW automobiles. I have been working on European vehicles as a technician for many years now and have a vast understanding of BMW products. I believe that the product knowledge I posses will offer an advantage in this field. Performance Automotive Group has a stellar reputation for sales, service and most importantly customer satisfaction. BMW awards their dealers who excel in local markets with a client satisfaction award that permits that particular dealer special advantages over others in their area. The BMW CSI award has been held by Performance for over seven consecutive years now.</p>

    <p class="description">I was hired under contract by a shop owner to develop his business. I completed the Midas franchise training program and received a franchise license. The main requirement for the course was to write an action plan and present it to the senior instructors at Midas HQ. My action plan and test scores reflected the fact that I have a very comprehensive understanding of all aspects of the retail side of auto service. Once I was awarded the franchise license I proceeded to organize the completion of what once was a three bay gas station in to a clean and comfortable Midas Shop. I trained the new employees and fulfilled my contract by the end of April. This was the most difficult task I have ever set my self against and it nearly worked me to an early grave! Time was crucial due to the owner running out of money. I spent many long days performing retail operations during business hours and then business development and management at night. It was a valuable learning experience.</p>
