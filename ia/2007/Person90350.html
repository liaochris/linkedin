<br>
My life's experience is eclectic, to say the least.  However, the common denominator has largely been sales and marketing.  I have been a professional radio broadcaster, radio commercial writer &amp; producer and radio advertising salesman.  That background led to my becoming a Wall Street stockbroker, selling stocks via the TELEphone (as opposed to a MICROphone) to main street America.  That, in turn, led to my becoming a Managing Director of Sales on Wall Street, recruiting and training other telephone salesmen.  This led to my becoming an internet marketer, initially selling proprietary sales and training products via the internet to the stockbroker community.  That business model was then expanded to the creation of programs for a variety of other professions using a similar format to that used to create my stockbroker programs.  Today I own a nationwide, internet based independent insurance agency, the growth of which has been nothing short of explosive!

    <p class="description">Affilliated Promotions was born of an idea that coupled my radio broadcasting &amp; Wall Street experiences combined with a page torn from the &quot;Tony Robbins playbook&quot;.  The initial products were audio sales training programs for stockbrokers and 'stockbroker wannabees&quot;.  The programs were recorded and edited through the courtesy of long time contacts in the radio broadcasting industry, utilizing radio station production facilties.  My original stockbroker indoctrination and sales training programs continue to be marketed via the internet through www.stockbroker-employment.com using my author's name, Warren Arthur (my first and middles names).  Other non related programs were later created using the same basic format, recorded in interview style; myself being the interviewer and experts in fields non-related to the financial world being the interviewees.  This was done in order to expand beyond the original market niche of financial sales.</p>

    <p class="description">From 1982 to 1997 I worked for a number of Wall Street investment banks.  Notable names would be Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb at their headquarters office at 55 Water Street &amp; Drexel Burnham Lambert.  I began as a &quot;soldier&quot; stockbroker, selling stocks via the telephone to main street America from Wall Street.  Over time my ability to craft highly effective sales presentations coupled with my ability to transfer my sales process to others was recognized and I was given the opportunity to recruit, train and manage telephone sales people.  It was one of the most personally rewarding periods of my career.  I developed a proprietary sales process that I would later &quot;bottle&quot; and market via the internet.

    <p class="description">My broadcasting career began while on active duty in The United States Navy from 1973 to 1977.  During those years I worked for The American Forces Radio Service in a capacity not dissimilar to the character portrayed by Robin Williams in the 1987 movie &quot;Good Morning Vietnam&quot;. I graduated from The Connecticut School of Broadcasting in Hartford, CT in 1977.  For the 5 years following my honorable discharge, from 1977 to 1982, I worked in a variety of capacities; On-Air Radio  Personality, Program Director, Music Director, Radio Commercial Writer &amp; Producer and Radio Advertising Salesman for Columbia Pictures Industries.  My passion was in radio commercial writing &amp; production..  That passion gave me a unique ability as a radio advertising salesman. I would call on customers and quickly craft an effective audio message that would motivate the customer to sign the contract on the line which is dotted, as well as create a clearly measurable increase in sales of the customer's product.</p>
