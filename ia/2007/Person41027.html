<br>
I was engaged to chart an action plan for the group, negotiate the deals between new affiliates and other 3rd party content providers, consult actual platform development, develop a working business plan which included identifying key staff to then manage the operation post my part-time consultancy/contract tenure.<br>
<br>

    <p class="description">* Hired by the Company’s Founder & MD, as one of their pioneer staff, I helped consult and construct the company’s web backbone/infrastructure which would coincide with the building of the core business model.  Two of its web portals (Cybermusicasia.com and XSmusic.com) served rich, interactive and localized music content targeting Malaysia and surrounding regional user/markets.<br>
<br>
* Successfully acquired exclusive partnership with the Recording Industry of Malaysia (RIM), the US Billboards Talent Network and various other local music content providers, to become Asia’s “one stop shop” for music/entertainment based content.  The company was also given exclusive rights to broadcast “never seen before” entertainment related material on the internet – first to break the Malaysian paradigm of “broadcast = TV & Radio only”.<br>
<br>
This was during a time Malaysians still bought Music cassettes.</p>

The Intranet platform provided various tools to assist the customer support team in managing their helpdesk & call center cases, while the Internet platform provided the customer/subscriber with applications (ie. FAQ, Freeware, OS updates etc) which would help minimize and/or resolve their ISP connectivity issues.<br>
<br>
