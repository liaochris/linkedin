          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Andy Budd&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>Andy Budd is a user experience designer and web standards developer living and working in Brighton, England. As the creative director of web design consultancy Clearleft (www.clearleft.com), Andy enjoys building attractive, accessible and standards compliant websites. His online home can be found at www.andybudd.com, where he writes about modern web design practices.<br>
<br>
Andy is a regular speaker at international design conferences, workshops and training events, as well as organizing d.Construct (www.dconstruct.org),  the UK&#x92;s first web 2.0 conference. Passionate about the quality of education in the industry, Andy runs SkillSwap (www.skillswap.org), a free community training and networking project. Andy also helped set up The Web Standards Awards (http://www.webstandardsawards.com), a project that aims to recognize websites for their use of web standards.<br>
<br>
Andy is the author of CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions (www.cssmastery.com) where he outlines modern web design best practice. He is also co-author of Blog Design Solution where he describes how to set-up, design and install your first weblog. Both of these books will be available in spring.<br>
<br>
Andy's design experience and knowledge has been called upon many times as a judge in web design awards, most recently the BUBU awards (www.bubuawards.net) and the CSS World Awards (http://awards.cssmania.com).<br>
 <br>
When he&#x92;s not building websites, Andy is a keen travel photographer. Never happier than when he&#x92;s diving some remote tropical atoll, Andy is also a qualified PADI dive instructor and retired shark wrangler.</p>

We love the Web and we understand how to make it work for your business. Clearleft are hired by clients who know the potential of the Web. We help you achieve that potential by learning about your business, listening to what you need and creating a website based on your business goals and centred upon the needs of your customers.<br>
<br>
As well as specialising in interaction and user experience design, we offer a full consultancy service as well as running regular training workshops in usability, accessibility and web standards. We also organise d.Construct, the first web 2.0 conference in the UK.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Judge and Co-Founder</h3>      <p><strong>Web Standards Awards</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Non-Profit; 1-10 employees; Internet industry)</p>  <p>            February 2004         &#8211; Present        (3 years)        </p>      <p class="desc">I helped set-up the Web Standards Awards along with Johan Edlund and Cameron Adams. These awards aim to promote web site design using W3C  standards by seeking out and highlighting the finest standards-compliant  sites on the Internet. By showing you standards-compliant sites that make your  jaw drop, we hope to show that web standards aren't a constraint, they are a  liberation.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Founder</h3>      <p><strong>SkillSwap</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Non-Profit; Myself Only; Internet industry)</p>  <p>            March 2003         &#8211; Present        (3 years 11 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">SkillSwap is a voluntary group set up by myself to provide free training to members of the local new media community.<br>
<br>
The idea is that on a semi-regular basis, people from the local new media community volunteer to give up some of their free time to train a small group of their peers in a subject that interests them. The events are intended to allow community members to share skills, help keep training costs down and do a little networking/socialising.<br>
<br>
The setting is small and informal and the subjects can be anything from hardcore programming topics through to softer business skills. Basically anything you&#x92;d be happy talking about that you think would be of interest to the new media community.<br>
<br>
By sharing informal training amongst community members we can cut down on the need for expensive training courses, learn a little about each other&#x92;s skills and do a little networking as well.</p>  </div>

<br>
While CSS is a relatively simple technology to learn, it is a difficult one to master. When you first start developing sites using CSS, you will come across all kinds of infuriating browser bugs and inconsistencies. It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve.<br>
<br>
By bringing all of the latest tips, tricks, and techniques together in one handy reference, this book demystifies the secrets of CSS and makes the journey to CSS mastery as simple and painless as possible. While most books concentrate on basic skills, this one is different, assuming that you already know the basics, and why you should be using CSS in your work, and concentrating mainly on advanced techniques.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Senior Web Designer</h3>      <p><strong>Message Digital Design</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Internet industry)</p>  <p>            May 1999         &#8211; March 2005        (5 years 11 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Involved in every aspect of the company from business development and project management through to design, production and rollout.
