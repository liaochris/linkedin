            <h2>Gary Williams&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                gary.williams@runbox.com<br>
I am an experienced line, programme, change, technology & relationship manager with extensive international experience & have managed change, business, technical & operational functions in a number of key industry sectors including finance, utilities, technology & retail. <br>
<br>
Whilst my 22 year Information Services career began with technical roles (software development, architecture, networking, communications & support) followed by consultancy, my key strengths are now based on my ability to manage & work with diverse teams across business & technical functions. I focus on ensuring timeliness, value, return on investment, alignment to strategy & quality of service. I have worked at director & vice president level in large international organisations, managing & matrix managing large numbers of staff & controlling multi-million £/$ budgets. In several roles I have worked directly with customers, clients & potential customers & I am experienced in communicating with a variety of groups to board level & including large audiences in a formal lecture, seminar or training environment. I have considerable experience of stakeholder management & relationship / account management & also have experience of communicating with the media & investor relations. I am attuned to organisational politics & have often worked in sensitive situations where negotiation & conflict resolution are required.   <br>
<br>
I have worked as a permanent employee & on an interim basis & am comfortable in either role. On two occasions I have joined organisations after originally coming in on an interim basis to turn around a failing function. In conclusion I bring clarity, experience & imagination, I do what I say I am going to do, I work well with people, manage with sensitivity but never lose sight of the overall goals & objectives of the organisation I serve or what it takes to achieve them. Basically I ensure that I deliver.

I oversaw the programme’s four workstreams, People, Process, Logical & Physical Architecture, driving & co-ordinating all change activities. The people workstream addressed skills, organisation & a focus on core competencies & working in partnership. This included elements of off-shore development, outsourced support & external hosting. The process workstream supported future organisational goals by imbedding improved process & ways of working based on recoginised industry standards. These include ITIL, a move to iterative software development using RUP within an overall MSP/PRINCE2 framework, new ways of modelling & developing with UML & the Rational toolset & a focus on CMMI.</p>

    <p class="description">I joined the Royal Bank of Scotland in July 2004, replacing an outgoing Programme Manager on a very short term engagement to complete the final stage of the Group Enterprise Platform roll-out to the bank’s branch network. This role involved management of five project managers managing a total of nineteen major infrastructure, desktop & bandwidth projects. <br>
<br>
In addition to programme management skills & a good understanding of PRINCE & ITIL, this role also demanded experience of working at board level, working with senior business management, supplier management, negotiation, conflict resolution, co-ordination with design & architecture groups, an understanding of retail banking, banking branch networks & management of major infrastructure projects</p>

My role required me to co-ordinate change between the Jupiter, ICON & Metering Programmes, spanning CRM, Billing, Industry data flows & Metering change projects. This was a high profile role which involved trouble shooting cross programme issues to maintain the overall time line & benefits case during the final phase of the Metering programme. <br>
<br>
In addition to programme & change management skills & a good understanding of PRINCE & ITIL, this role also demanded an in-depth understanding of the utilities industry & an ability to negotiate & agree SLAs & KPIs with Centrica’s Service Delivery functions on behalf of internal business customers.</p>
