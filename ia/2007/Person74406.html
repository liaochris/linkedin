          <h2>Rory Blyth&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              My boss thinks I'm nice.<br>
<br>
I have an above average knowledge of fine fragrances, both for males and females.<br>
<br>
I regularly drive at speeds in excess of 110 MPH, and I've only had one speeding ticket in my entire life, and I only had to pay a third of it, and that was after fighting it out with the judge over mail. All I had to to was convince her of how awesome I was, which only took, like, ONE SENTENCE.<br>
<br>
I am not afraid of you. At all.<br>
<br>
I'm very aggressive, and I'll run right over you to get the job I want. You know those videos where &quot;monster&quot; trucks drive over the top of a line of cars and demolish all of them? I'm the truck, and you're the cars. I'm a leech on every organization that will accept me.<br>
<br>
I'm also a communist.<br>
<br>
And, if you offer me food with either pig or mushrooms in it, I'll spit in your face and then burn your house down.<br>
<br>
That's why I'm perfect for this opportunity.<br>
<br>
Also, if you're here because you're thinking of hiring me, then please keep the following two (2) pieces of information in mind:<br>
<br>
1. I AM AWESOME.<br>
<br>
2. If you want me to work for you, then you have to give me insane quantities of money (&quot;insane&quot; can be described as &quot;at least $1,000,000.00 per DAY&quot;).<br>
<br>
If you think that's too much, then consider bringing me on as a consultant for just a few minutes.<br>
<br>
The average work day is about eight hours, so it'd only cost you $125,000.00 per HOUR to bring me on as a consultant.<br>
<br>
If THAT'S too steep, then consider my &quot;By the Minute Discounted Rate&quot; of $2,084.00 per MINUTE.<br>
<br>
You can certainly afford the discounted rate.<br>
<br>
So what are you waiting for?<br>
<br>
(Also, I can do more work with my pinky in thirty seconds than your entire outsourced, offshored workforce could do in ONE HUNDRED YEARS, so I'm a BARGAIN. I AM SOOOOOO AWESOME.)<br>
<br>
That is all.
            </p>
            <h3>Rory Blyth&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
            <p class="skills">
              Basically, I'm just really smart, and people want me to do things. I'm also kind of good looking, so I've done some modeling. But, mainly, people want my think-meat to make success happen for them, and I'm happy to trade a few of my idle thoughts for your money. So, my expertise is getting paid.

      <p class="notes">When I dropped out, it was with a .86 GPA, which in itself is a sort of accomplishment. I mean, a 0.0 implies that I didn't show up.<br>
<br>
So don't get me wrong. I *tried*. I was just too busy going to the beach during the day and playing with hex editors at night to care about what the moral message behind &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was. All I remember is that Boo Radley was effin' weird, man. Like, totally messed up. But then not. You know - like people had their prejudices.<br>
<br>
OK. So I guess I learned something.<br>
<br>
BUT THAT'S ALL. I DIDN'T LEARN *ANYTHING* ELSE.<br>
<br>

		<dl class="activities-societies">
			<dt>Activities and Societies:</dt>
			<dd>I mainly got into fights and then stopped showing up because I thought that it was more important to drink beer and go surfing than it was to interact with jocks on a social level. In spite of my lack of education, I'm still probably smarter than you are, and I can quote poetry in four languages (that I actually understand), and I've lived in three countries, started a couple companies, and generally been successful at everything. So screw this education crap. My speciality is smartness.</dd>
