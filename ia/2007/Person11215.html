Recruited into the Data Test Center as the Western Region Manager overseeing remote DS0 - DS1 testing for the 4 western regions of MCI.  Responsible to drive the "business side" of the Network Management Center. Contributions included integrating a "business outlook" on the operations, development of individual to overall center productivity reporting and a "Post 599" (post-installation) communication process.  After four months in the Data Test center I was asked assigned to take over the national Network Management Proactive Services (NMPS) organization with a directive to relocate, build, grow and develop an organizational future direction.</p>

Contributed a 25% reduction in net fraud credits in lieu of a 17% net increase in MCI product revenues. The absolute accuracy rate for all fraud related incidents was greater than 98%.  Per month productivity increased 250% from 8,000 deactivations in 4/95 to 20,410 deactivations in 12/95.  Since taking leadership in 3/95 the 40 employee center atmosphere changed from a "hostile", low productivity environment to one of a standards based, synergistic and motivated teamwork setting, yielding consistent and reliable results.  As one of the two centers that monitored the MCI global network, during 1995 my center contributed a bottom line annual return to the MCI stockholders of $45 million.  Received a Significantly Exceeds rating on the Responsibilities/Performance section of the 1995 performance management appraisal review.</p>

              <h3>Bill Moersch&#8217;s Interests:</h3>
              <p class="interests">As a Christian in faith my primary focus is my personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.  As a result, my definition of success is defined as &quot;the amount of &quot;Jesus&quot; people see in me.&quot; 

My 2nd priority is my lovely wife and best friend, Jean.  Next is our children, Shawn (21), Bethany (19) and Zach (18).  

I'm real big on relationships... because Jesus died on the cross as a result of His relational love for us.... ya see, it's all about people. 

Other interests are leading Men&#x2019;s Ministry at Bethel Church, C5DREAM my Corvette, hittin&#x2019; the road in our 38 foot diesel-pusher motor coach, geocaching, BIG watches, a good dark cigar, a warm fire on a cold Saturday morning, meaty-crisp bacon, hot-black coffee, playing surf-guitar and hiking in and around Lake Tahoe.

In a nut shell... I want to me known as &#x201c;the best&#x201d; at what I do because I do my best to serve others while serving The Lord and living out my faith on a per person and per day level.</p>
