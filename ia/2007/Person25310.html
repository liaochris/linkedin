            <h2>David Hooker&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am a highly skilled software professional, with substantial experience in a wide array of technologies, industries, and business environments.  More than nineteen years of professional programming and consulting experience in a variety of fields contributes to a broad experience base in many areas of software development.<br>
<br>
As a software engineer, I acquired an extensive repertoire of technical abilities.  Primary technical strengths include object-oriented programming using C, C++, and Java. I am experienced in UNIX/Linux, MS-Windows (all versions), OS/2, OS-9000, and embedded environments, and am proficient in low-level programming in assembly languages.  I design elegant solutions to complex problems, and generate a clean implementation. I have proven performance at every level of development, from specification and architecture to design to all levels of implementation. <br>
<br>
As a leader and manager of development projects, I have gained experience in defining and using development methodologies and processes, and building and leading technical teams.  Several years of leadership experiences include leading teams of developers, planning and tracking projects, project management, budgeting and ROI analysis, and new business development.  Exposure to various companies and industries gives insight into differing development environments, people, and challenges.<br>
<br>
Recently joined a small but very quickly growing company where I am building and leading the software development organization.  We are building software for consumer-level banking kiosks as well as the back-end transaction processing, reporting, and management applications.  We need talented individuals to help us! Contact me if interested.
