            <h2>Reuben Fine&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                "There has to be a better way" ... a statement I have consistently challenged whenever I have encountering situations that have frustrated or annoyed me especially in business. <br>
<br>
For the past 5+ years I have worked as a freelance graphic designer for the real estate industry, making marketing and promotional flyer materials for real estate agents. Frustrated by the redundancy of creating the same marketing materials time and time again, I embarked on a journey to "find a better way." <br>
<br>
2 years into my quest and with help from my business partner Rey Marques, we have finally built the solution. The answer: a web application that automatically designs and produces marketing and promotional flyers for real estate agents called Pipeline Producer. www.PipelineProducer.com Pipeline Producer is a really easy streamlined system that reduces the design process by creating various marketing materials at once, saving agents time and effort. Through our web app an agent can CREATE a whole 9 piece marketing campaign (from Just Listed, to Just Sold), PRINT their pieces at home, the office, or through our professional printshop, and MAIL or FARM their announcement postcards around the neighborhood within minutes, rather than hours or even days! It's pretty revolutionary.<br>
<br>
Onto our next venture, while in college, Rey and I became increasingly frustrated with the inefficiencies and redundancies in research. Again, I challenged, "there has to be a better way." After countless hours in development, we have rolled out our second entrepreneurial venture that can and will be the solution to the problem. Currently, the venture is in private beta testing and is scheduled to be announced publicly later in 2007. <br>
<br>
For the future, I hope to change, or at least shift the world with my ideas. I know I cannot do it with one single shot, so I'll have to "Change the world one idea at a time."
