              First off, what a great site this is.  Kudos to all of you who make it so.  .<br>
<br>
A LITTLE ABOUT ME:<br>
<br>
I am here<br>
I am here to help<br>
I am here to help you<br>
<br>
It's a really big world and we are all just one person.  If you are like me, you have a really big job to do and If you can't count on the law of generosity, the likelihood of your success diminishes.<br>
<br>
What's the law of generosity you ask?<br>
<br>
Here's my version:<br>
<br>
Good brings good.<br>
<br>
The universe is aware of the good thoughts, beliefs, deeds, etc. and acts in a manner of making such actions consistent. Simply stated, as I do good by you, the universe will continue doing good by me.<br>
<br>
The rub of course is I can't help you if you don't tell me how.<br>
<br>
Networking has to start with an expressed need. Help me help you so we can both be helped. You can do two things for me:<br>
<br>
Understand that my main purpose here is to help create opportunities for others.<br>
<br>
Let me know who I can help so we can all benefit.<br>
<br>
I am motivated by helping others succeed.  <br>
<br>
I am at once an attractor a facilitator and a connector.  I attract and facilitate knowledge, partnerships, opportunities and resources. I uncover needs and connect the needy with the appropriate solution provider(s).  I listen to people's thoughts, help them define their desires and connect them with the resources to see them fulfilled.<br>
<br>
HOW YOU CAN HELP ME:<br>
<br>
My current position has me attracting and retaining top level sales talent for Cavalier Business Communications.  I am looking for GREAT sales folks in these areas with whom to network:<br>
<br>
Alabama<br>
DC<br>
Delaware<br>
Florida<br>
Georgia<br>
Kentucky<br>
Louisiana<br>
Michigan<br>
Mississippi<br>
North Carolina<br>
Ohio<br>
Pennsylvania<br>
Tennessee<br>
Virginia<br>
<br>
Please contact me at tbean@talk.com.<br>
<br>
I am always open to meeting networkers and recruiters.   If you are seeking to do business in Detroit, we can likely introduce you to the people you need to meet.

    <p class="description">This is the coolness to which I referred under my role at LDMI.<br>
<br>
On December 15, 2006, the deal was finalized and completed the sale of Talk America to Cavalier.  It is an outstanding merger that has quickly created the largest Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) East of the Mississippi.<br>
<br>
My formal role here is as the Corporate Recruiter.  The way I see it, I am responsible for both brand promotion and creating opportunities.  <br>
<br>
We have several markets in each of the states that I mentioned above.  I am very interested in meeting people that would like to work for us or with us in any sort of business development capacity.  We have outstanding opportunities for employees, agents and business partners alike.<br>

<br>
This could some day be a great place when outsourced sales and permission based/referral based marketing take hold.  There are plenty of ideas to make this fun.<br>

    <p class="description">This was great conceptually.  Unfortunately, we were long on ideas and a little short on implementation.  Not having cash is always a killer.  We built a CLEC that went from zero to a profitable sale in less than 28 months. We partnered with non-profit organizations and gave them a unique fund-raising opportunity through the sale of phone service.  It was fun, good people and I learned some new things about both telco and myself.</p>

The whole bust hit smaller companies before the larger ones (no kidding, tell us more Dr. finance).  This little entity had a cool website and showed some promise as a national provider.  What you didn't know until you got there is that unless you were in one of 6 markets (go figure, Detroit wasn't one of them) they were basically selling Long Distance.  I wanted to sell VPN, hosting and Frame Relay, not quite the same thing.  I also learned how to not manage people.  Thanks CF.</p>

In fact, as I have gotten back into recruiting, I have started networking recruiters again.  Too many times recruiters have the right job or the right candidate.  My thought has always been that 50% is better than 0%,  It always struck me as odd when others didn't see it that way.  Oh well, their loss.</p>

      <p class="notes">Selected for a Graduate Assistantship that allowed me to teach CTA 124.  This was one of only 4 mandatory classes at E.M.U.  It's kind of cool to get to try out a career at someone else's expense.  I enjoyed the teaching, not so much the planning or the grading.  It was interesting to teach people that were significantly older than I.  Ran into a couple of people that didn't care for my humor.  Actually, I don't know how much I would care for the humor that I possessed at 23.  Oh who am I kidding, I still I think I am funny.</p>

      <p class="notes">I quickly discovered that U of M was about 12 minutes away from E.M.U.  Although I didn't have the grades to be accepted, I certainly had the wit.  I enjoyed spending time in A2.  I took a position as a bouncer in a bar and got promoted up through to management.  Bartending was one of my best experiences in life.  Met  a lot of good people and enjoyed the exchanges.  Good food, good drinks, good friends, good times.  RIP O'sullivan's c.(1988-1995)</p>
