            <h2>Niklas Karlsson&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have been active in the IT industry in various roles for 15+ years, with a broad experience ranging from software consulting to software sales companies. Specializing in partner and sales management, I have been a part of several company start-ups. I have a result oriented, entrepreneurial mind-set paired with experience from large, multi-national sales organisations. Managing business through partners has always been part of my role, and I have negotiated partner agreements from both sides of the table.<br>
<br>
I have a solid business education (MBA), and have had roles ranging from technical expert to senior level sales and business development.
