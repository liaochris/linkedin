            <h2>Nigel Ramsay&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Commercial Experience<br>
<br>
I have been involved in the software industry for over 10 years. I have progressed from a Programmers position to Technical Lead, with responsibilities for technical leadership and architecture. I have particular experience with consulting firms and the financial industry &#x2013; both in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. <br>
<br>
Architectural Design<br>
<br>
I am confident in designing the architecture for J2EE based systems, and their interaction with non-Java technologies. My experience with the diverse technologies at both Government and Financial institutions, as the unique challenges provided at technology start-ups, give me a sound architectural background. I have been defining project architectures for 4 years.<br>
<br>
Leadership<br>
<br>
As the Technical Lead, I am responsible for managing the Java Developers in my team. This includes allocation of work, monitoring and reviewing progress, and overseeing the resolution of any issues that arise.  <br>
<br>
I also work with the Lead Business Analyst and the Project Manager in reviewing and clarifying business requirements and exploring the most effective ways to meet the needs of the business.

<br>
My role was to provide architectural oversight and development for this J2EE and Visual Basic project. <br>
<br>
Loan Automation Project <br>
<br>
The diverse technologies used reflect the integrated nature of this application. Visual Basic is used on the client, and this communicates with both Weblogic and Tuxedo servers. XML is used as the communication mechanism between client and server. The Weblogic server communicates with an IBM mainframe application via an MTS gateway. The database is Oracle, and the OS is Solaris. We use JMS for asynchronous processes and scheduled offline tasks.<br>
<br>
My role was to design and develop new features for this application. Also, as a Senior Analyst / Programmer, I assisted in the development and mentoring of staff. We use the Rational Unified Process. <br>
<br>
Tools used include Eclipse, Ant, CVS, SourceSafe, and Log4j.</p>

    <p class="description">My Global Markets portal <br>
Responsible for the architecture, design and development of a portal framework which allows customers of Deutsche Bank to select and display customised information on a personal web page. <br>
<br>
We provided common functionality - for example, custom JSP tag libraries, and auto-save functionality for edit pages. This was successful as we ended up having portlets developed by other divisions - from New York and London. In fact, one of the other divisions was so impressed that they decided to stop their development with Weblogic Personalisation Server and move to our custom portal framework. <br>
<br>
The portal was based on &quot;Model 2&quot; JSP and Servlet technology. This ran under an iPlanet based server. We later added in support from Weblogic 6 for EJB Session Beans. The database was Oracle 8i. The operating system was Solaris. We used other technologies such as Ant, Log4j, and database connection pooling from the Apache group.</p>

<br>
Responsible for the development of the Intranet based web application for managing the detection, enforcement and removal of illegal media on the Internet.<br>
<br>
The application managed various external search services through a Servlet / XML interface. It provided the information required for a search to take place, and received the results. The results were passed to an EJB Session for persistence in an Oracle Database.<br>
<br>
IFPI's staff around the world could view the collected information through a web browser. The findings would be grouped to create various 'cases' such as investigations, escalations, etc. <br>
<br>
Other features included user management, security, email generation, &quot;whois&quot; queries, reverse-dns queries, HTTP redirection detections, etc. We used JavaScript based client-side validation. In short, the application managed the client's entire business process in a highly automated manner.</p>

IBM were developing C++ and Java based upgrades to an existing Customer Management application. The application managed many business processes at the call centres of Telecommunications Companies.<br>
<br>
Research Project <br>
<br>
I was sponsored by IBM to perform research into new Internet Technologies. This was the research portion of my thesis for the Master of Technology degree. <br>
<br>
I designed and developed two major proof-of-concept applications. The first application investigated how Java technologies could be used to harness information in an existing database. It provided electronic commerce capabilities over the Internet using Java Applets.<br>
<br>
The second application that I developed used CORBA to link an existing C++ based application to a Java Applet. This application made use of the existing functionality to provide new services.</p>

<br>
I was sponsored by IBM to perform research into new Internet Technologies. This was the research portion of my thesis for the Master of Technology degree. <br>
<br>
I designed and developed two major proof-of-concept applications. The first application investigated how Java technologies could be used to harness information in an existing database. It provided electronic commerce capabilities over the Internet using Java Applets. <br>
<br>
The second application that I developed used CORBA to link an existing C++ based application to a Java Applet. This application made use of the existing functionality to provide new services.</p>
