            <h2>Andrew Cardwell&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                * Excellent information security manager with experience in multi-national corporations<br>
* Proven technical ability and hands on expertise <br>
* Good communication and leadership skills<br>
* Team and Project Management involving multi-millions in revenue and costs<br>
* Driven, Positive, Result Focussed<br>
<br>
I specialise in information security management, policy, process, procedures, legislation, audit and compliance, risk management and security awareness but I can cover many other areas of information security including physical, telecommunication and network.  I have had lots of experience in large outsource deals and their security implications.<br>
<br>
I hold many respected security management and audit qualifications including the CISM, CISA, CISSP, BS7799 Lead Auditor and ISO27001 Master Implementor.  I am also an associate-member of the newly formed Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP).<br>
<br>
I am happy to hear from anyone wishing to connect, network, chat, discuss non-exec director positions etc.<br>
<br>
Email is preferred as a first option just to save time and more importantly fit it in around a busy working day!<br>
<br>
I am considering emigrating within the next two years.  Countries considered are Australia, New Zeland, India and UAE but I'm open to other suggestions.  If you have any information about emigrating to these countries or possible job opportunities in these countries then please get in touch.
