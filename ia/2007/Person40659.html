    <p class="description">Set up to create a Silicon Valley like startup environment in LON, MUN, AMS, PAR and SWE, GP was the leading incubator in EUR during the great bubble of 2000/2001. <br>
<br>
Only the best of the best was good enough. The best people, the best biz plans (we reviewed > 10.000), the best entrepreneurs, the best parties, you named it. The energy and atmosphere were exhilarating and enormously stimulating!  <br>
<br>
We raised a bit more than $50M from Goldman, Deutsche, ABN, Rabo, C&W in 2 rounds. In hindsight we should have raised more early on, because when we went back to the market for a 3rd round, the window was closed, and we had to downsize as fast as we had build the company up. Fortis/Nesbic were the only shareholders that continued to support us. <br>
<br>
Thnx to the model and the quality of the team, and despite the mistakes we made, the number of winners, like GPXS, Vizuri, Natural Motion, Webperform (Gomez), Vibrant and Pharmeon funded by  GP has been above average.</p>
