            <h2>Eli Goldberg&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am a graduate student in user experience research (through the Department of Technical Communication) at the University of Washington. <br>
<br>
As a user researcher, I combine a decade of experience as a usability-focused senior software test engineer with academic training in qualitative and quantitative usability research methods, cognitive work analysis, and information design. This combination of experience enables me to not only identify the high-level usability issues in a product as a traditional usability researcher, but also to "think like a software tester" and find the submerged polish issues that become apparent in the hands of real-world usage by tens of millions of customers.<br>
<br>
Available for an internship or contract position in Spring/Summer, 2008.

    <p class="description">My primary usability consulting clients at LUTE were a local healthcare informatics company, Talaria, and the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD). For Talaria, I authored an extensive heuristic review of a social website under development, and documented issues observed in usability test sessions.<br>
<br>
For ESD, I was the primary researcher for a major redesign of their primary external website. My responsibilities included designing, recruiting for, and conducting a mid-sized card sort and co-authoring a report of the results, together with Elisabeth Cuddihy (assistant lab director). I also performed heuristic and expert evaluations of iterative design mockups for the ESD website, offering research-based and empirically-based recommendations for changes to the design direction. <br>
<br>
In my academic research for LUTE, I am currently evaluating emerging methods in recent (2002-2007) eye-tracking research and application throughout the HCI and related communities.</p>

Prometheus is an award-winning publisher of space and science-fiction themed music used in planetariums, museums and classrooms worldwide. Tracks from our most recent release, To Touch the Stars, were licensed by NASA for their Emmy award-winning SCI Files television series, and were played by NASA/JPL as wake-up music on Mars for the Opportunity rover (Sol 20). Astronaut Buzz Aldrin endorsed the album after being moved to tears on national television, quoting lyrics from the album.

The press campaign I conducted for this release yielded dozens of instances of radio, television, newspaper, magazine and Internet press coverage reaching tens of millions of people.
