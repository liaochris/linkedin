            <h2>Markus Krebsz&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Strategic management consultant with expert knowledge in Securitisation & Rating agency spaces - worked for 14+ years for major European banks and Financial institutions.<br>
<br>
Currently working on an assignment consulting BoS Treasury's Structured Investments Credit and Counterparty Credit Sanctioning teams.<br>
<br>
Worked until recently for RBS's Group Treasury where I was instrumental in articulating and shaping the banks future securitisation strategy.  <br>
<br>
Previously, I worked for Fitch Ratings as a rating analyst in the corporate & infrastructure (C&I) securitisation team focusing on trade receivables, leases, and inventory, as well as transport and infrastructure and other government related deals. Prior to that I was part of Fitch's European ABS performance analytics team covering the surveillance for C&I transactions and have also been involved in product development such as the Fitch Issuer Report Grades and the post-issuance reporting standards. During the time there I helped defining and setting the reporting standards for the European Commercial ABS market. <br>
<br>
Acting in a variety of Advisory and Consultancy capacities. In addition, I am also member of various research groups where I provide insight and opinion. <br>

Currently working on a couple of books as part of a well-known publisher’s forthcoming ‘International Capital markets’ series.<br>
