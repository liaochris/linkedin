    <p class="description">Document Architects, Rockville MD, was spun out from development that Digital Architects did with Lotus Development Corporation's Architected Solutions Group and IBM Global Services.  The shared intellectual property (IP) was a software system that performed long-term high fidelity document retention, metadata management, data mining and search.  The creation of Document Architects was specifically intended to commercialize the IP developed with IBM. To support this we raised a round of friends and family in late 1998 for about $150K. Note this included funding from Digital Architects as well. We had 5 full time developers plus a business development person.  We had light house customers at the World Bank Group. Round A financing was pursued through NextGen Capital in late 1999 early 2000. Unfortunately, the bubble burst in 2000 and our round A financing fell through.  The company wound down in mid 2000.</p>
