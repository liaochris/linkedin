<br>
I am currently a Director of Businesses Development for the Cisco Channel at RedSky Technologies. My role is defined as working on three key initiatives:<br>
<br>
First with Cisco as a partner to provide information exchange on RedSky Technologies core product, E911 Manager and work with identified individuals and Business Units within Cisco to increase awareness and help BU's sell more of their product.<br>
<br>
My second initiative is to register high-end Cisco Voice Reseller Partners as resellers of the RedSky product line to their Fortune 500 Enterprise customer base. This initiative includes but is not limited to providing training material, train the respective sales force and make joint sales presentations educating customers as to the need to develop and deploy an E911 offering from RedSky Technologies.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I work closely with the RedSky Technologies Sales Directors to target Cisco specific customers, make customer facing presentations and assist in closing the sale as they relate to our Cisco product offering.<br>
<br>
I maintain an awareness of the applications currently being developed by the numerous partners of the major players in the convergence industry whose applications target specifically E911 and more in general Homeland Security requirements for State and Federal entities, thus am open to hearing from others in this growing space.<br>
<br>
As for LinkedIn Users, If I or my contacts have an interest to you, I welcome your requests to connect to me directly, or will consider forwarding requests as long as you can tell me a bit about yourself, or make yourself available for a brief discussion about your request.
