    <p class="description">Co-Owner | CHEROKEE SPUR | 1993 - 1995<br>
<br>
I First started with the Company in October of 93, and as a going concern we couldn't cope with the influx of business and the decision was made to expand the business, a new premises was bought and converted in to a purpose built Restaurant, 253 pax, with separate smoking and non smoking areas with independent aircon units, setting a new standard at the time for non smoking patrons, it was to become municipal law several months later that required many Restaurants to convert to similar models. On the 15 September 2004 my partners and I opened the 1st New Line Spur in South Africa, it was a pilot Store for Malaysia, Australia, and various countries to follow as a franchise. Management of the Restaurant achieved A Grade Operational Levels ratings from the Spur Franchise Group. Whilst working with the group I was instrumental in the design of the Personalised Greeting mats, that are commonplace at Spurs around the world today.</p>
