          <h2>Louis Ewens&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              An entertainment industry professional who brings technical know-how, fresh ideas and a wealth of experience to the table. With a career that spans from the first wave of microcomputers to today&#x2019;s distributed Internet applications, I specialize in creating new and engaging consumer experiences.<br>
<br>
Throughout my career I have been dedicated to quality and innovation. Solving technical challenges with creative thinking is my passion. While I have developed many solo projects, I prefer working in an interactive team environment. I&#x2019;ve been doing Agile development since before it had a name. My most valuable ability is being able to assess a situation very quickly and accurately.<br>
<br>
My current technology tool set of choice is LAMP+MVC using Apache, PHP 5 and MySQL 5. I have a history of creating large-scale internet applications for big entertainment companies. But I also excel in the start-up and small company environment.

<br>
Chief Architect of the new entertainment portal, SeenON.com. Part search engine and part community, the site blends the &quot;As Seen In&quot; shopping metaphor into stand-alone consumer entertainment. A custom back end console allows editorial staff to maintain up-to-the-minute control over content.<br>
<br>
Following an MVC application pattern on this project allowed a small development team to produce a relatively large amount of online features in a very short amount of time. It also allowed us to easily create a custom, search friendly URL structure. PHP 5's new object-oriented features afford better control of the application logic while facilitating easier code re-use.</p>

<br>
Major projects included the prototype for a new e-commerce system at a pre-funding start-up. As CTO I managed development efforts while also acting as Chief Architect and Engineer on the project. Later I represented company technology innovation to investors during initial funding efforts.<br>
<br>
For Lucasfilm I was asked to evaluate a proprietary internal web development system. My feedback would ultimately be the decision-making factor for whether the company would pursue the project further. The report included a full technical assessment, work flow and market feasibility study.<br>
<br>
At Plan B Enterprises I set the technology course for a new venture &quot;Girls Horse Club,&quot; a strategically crafted entertainment property for preteen and young teen girls who love animals. Open Source software allowed this young start-up to quickly build several custom entertainment applications.</p>

<br>
In this role I was able to use my technical skill and experience to recognize where there were overlapping areas of technology in this large media company. By developing cross-over communication lines and technology propagation between business units, I was able to find areas of optimization that reduced expense while boosting productivity.<br>
<br>
One of my major projects was to evaluate software-on-demand products from several vendors in order to find the best fit for Disney. All aspects of these hosted online services were addressed including innovation level, features, customer experience, hosting facilities, DRM, security and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<br>
My role included developing the network design, server layout, load balancing, security and storage options for the project (Cisco, Sun, F5, Auspex). I developed a blend of open source, commercial and custom software to define the interactive layers for this huge online community. (Apache, PHP, Oracle, Perl, Shell Scripts) On the planning and management side I produced the online policies, budgets and strategic plans for the entire system.<br>
<br>
After the initial release I developed an online localization CMS for use with all Maxis products. This stand-alone application made it easy for the company to manage and translate entire web sites of content into many different languages.</p>

Principal engineer of Red Orb Zone, the division's proprietary game matching service. Built in C++, this self-contained module closely meshed with Microsoft DirectX on the client side to provide chat and game matching services for any number of online games. It became the standard game matching service for all online titles. I was awarded the 1998 Broderbund Intellectual Capital Award for outstanding achievements.<br>
<br>
Built several game specific multi-player communication engines. Dealing with 33.6 modem speeds and excessive packet latency required us to be very creative with how the applications responded under such duress.</p>
