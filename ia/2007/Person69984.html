          <h2>Qui Vuong&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              As a contrarian thinker, I advocate &quot;Absolute Return&quot; investing. I am an &quot;early adopting&quot; facilitator with broad operational and technical experience in all phases of the investment management process. <br>
<br>
I counsel accredited investors on building high performance portfolios through thinking differently, and on getting the most out of asymmetric returns in alternative investments. I also help savvy entrepreneurs and investment managers attain balance and meaning in their own endeavors. <br>
<br>
I work with leading experts, but always stray outside of my comfort zone to access fresh inspiration and undiscovered solutions that might have emerged suddenly while I was sleeping, turning more &quot;What If's&quot; into &quot;What's Next.&quot;     <br>
<br>
My 22-year career has been dedicated toward exploring new and forbidden horizons, asking unpopular questions in order to expose what works, what makes sense, and discovering alternative solutions that best serve the interests of my private clients and the public constituents whom I represent. <br>
<br>
I possess broad understanding, direct experience, and crossover training from the many hats I wear representing buy side and sell side interests throughout my professional career. I have learned from many mentors - successful practitioners and specialists - in many areas: capital markets, discretionary and proprietary trading, portfolio hedging and global risk management, enlightened wealth management &amp; philantropy, investor education, fiduciary empowerment, and best practices advocacy.<br>
<br>
I am interested in &quot;investing early&quot; in new ideas, emerging managers, undiscovered niche markets, special situations, and compelling technology crossover startups within the financial services industry.<br>
 <br>
I always look for ways to collaborate with fellow angel investors and visionary venture capitalists to help entrepreneurs build new business enterprises that help people improve the quality of their own lives while changing the world for the better.
