<br>
I am a versatile person with broad previous experiences and knowledge bases, vigorously dedicating in many different areas and working as a charming team player and a shadow leader.<br>
<br>
First of first, I am a pro-am photographer and writer, which means I have never obtained professional trainings in above fields but love them from my deep heart. <br>
<br>
Besides them, I am a researchers.<br>
<br>
I concentrated my research on social and political studies in China, and developed it into two correlated branches. One is the fundamental investigation on the motivation, mechanism, repertoire, and effect of policy-making in both ancient and modern China under both micro- and macro-history perspectives. Another is on the specifically social, policy, legal, and economic environments of new technology, especially the information and communication technology (ICT), business applications and implements of ICT, and interrelationships of all these factors in China.<br>
<br>
Also, a community participator, a visionary and a practitioner I am. <br>
<br>
With my friends I established and managed a society of more than 80 members. I not only designed and directed the website project of school and created the cultural tour project for student delegations from Taiwan.Working in several positions such as administrative assistant, photographer, journalist, columnist, and surveyor.<br>
<br>
Being a self-starter.<br>
<br>
Through learning, determination, and accurate planning and implement, I created a comprehensive set of new life styles, successfully managed to lose weight of more than 45 kg, healthily maintained the level till now, and willingly spread these ideas and practices to other people.
