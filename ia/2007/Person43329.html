            <p>Dropped out of college to be a DJ in a nightclub and do computer network consulting on the side. Started one of the first web companies to go public in Japan, helped establish IIKK/PSINet Japan, the first commercial ISP in Japan, and Infoseek Japan. Was on the Ars Electronica Net category for Internet art for 7 years and helped define the criteria for Internet art. Actively involved in Japanese government policy, both in law making and active citizen participation in protesting bad laws. Particularly interested in security and privacy related issues.<br>
<br>
Main focus now is Technorati, Six Apart, Digital Garage and Creative Commons.<br>
<br>
Hope to influence the world in a good way and continue to grow my network of social entrepreneurs.<br>
