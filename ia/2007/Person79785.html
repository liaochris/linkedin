            <p>During my career, I have acquired holistic knowledge of the software product development lifecycle through engagements in technical and business disciplines, and I have an advanced understanding of how these disciplines interoperate to achieve objectives.  I started as a software developer writing C++ code for embedded real-time UNIX systems and later transferred to enterprise applications and Java. I moved from team leadership to development management, focusing on project management, methodologies and processes, testing and quality assurance, and cultivated a coaching style that is hands-on, people-centric and based on values and principles. For the last 6 years, my work has concentrated on agile methods. I am a Practicing Certified Scrum Master, independent agile coach and consultant with extensive experience in software product development (using Scrum, Extreme Programming and Lean techniques), leading agile teams, and helping organisations adopt agile methods. <br>
<br>
I am focused on producing tangible results from day one. I am decisive, confident, and calm under pressure. I am creative and diligent, with an eye for detail and a methodical and practical approach to problem solving. I can think strategically and tactically. I am a proponent of people-centric approaches to projects and software development.</p>
