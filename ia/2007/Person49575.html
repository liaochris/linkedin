          <h2>Kyle Hunt | kyle@hunthosting.com&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              My experience and expertise is in working for and with small businesses.  The Internet is giving savvy small business owners the ability to generate a solid stream of new business. Great websites and smart local search marketing can be excellent ways to grow their business very cost effectively.<br>
<br>
Traditional print Yellow Pages are on their way out and several other &quot;traditional&quot; marketing methods are losing their effectiveness as media becomes more and more fragmented.<br>
<br>
I aim to help small businesses create an online presence that produces results.  Are you apologetic or proud of your website? A great website should be the centerpiece of your marketing and a place you happily point potential and current clients.<br>
<br>
Why else do I spend many of my waking hours helping small business owners? Because my wife and I have a beautiful baby boy&#x85;and those diapers are darn expensive...

    <p class="description">Created Major League Cards, an online, e-commerce driven baseball card business.  Organized thousands of cards on the site in a meticulous way to help customers easily shop and buy.  Handled customer service, purchasing, pricing, shipping, accounting, and technology.<br>
<br>
Learned how to add value to a business, the ability to carve out a target market, how to adapt to and research the competition, and how to optimize a web site to maximize sales.<br>
<br>
Sold the domain name to investors in February of 2005 and quietly stepped out of the hobby that I had loved since I was a little six-year-old Detroit Tigers fan.</p>

    <p class="description">Managed a diverse group of five ad reps who sold display advertising for Western Michigan University's student newspaper, The Western Herald.<br>
<br>
Responsibilities included interviewing and hiring new ad reps, running sales meetings, motivating and training ad reps, selling advertising, handling payroll and customer complaints.  Consistently dealt with deadlines and pressure to exceed monthly sales goals.<br>
<br>
In my eyes this was the best business related student job on Western Michigan University&#x2019;s campus. The interaction with local businesses, university leadership, college departments, and students was enlightening.<br>
<br>
Knowing that your department brings in 95% of the newspaper&#x2019;s revenue turns the pressure of the job up a bit, but at the same time makes it very rewarding.</p>

<br>
I focused the marketing of this program at high schools in Michigan and sold and supported the program to dozens of schools.<br>
<br>
One coach that purchased the program owns the company I work for, Long Mechanical, and this program is what introduced the two of us.  You never know where or when your next connection or opportunity will come about.</p>
