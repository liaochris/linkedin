            <h2>Giovanni Diviacchi&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm originally from a small town outside Chicago called Cicero.  You may have heard it in the national news, it's usually followed by the phrase &quot;mob related&quot; or &quot;racially motivated.&quot; The street I lived on was part of the Adopt a Roadway program. My street was adopted by the Tortellini crime family of Chicago.  It made for an interesting dynamic, in that we lived on the safest, in terms of unreported crime, and cleanest street in Cicero, but on the other hand, they turned my street into a toll road.  It cost me five dollars to go to and from school each day. The house we lived in was designed by Frank Lloyd Rite, spelled R-I-T-E, and it was very unique because it was built in the back of a miniature gold course golf.  The 16th hole ran through our kitchen.<br>
Did you hear that Bill Gates and his wife are going to have a new baby boy?  Yeah, they&#x2019;re going to call him Bill Gates 2.0.<br>
Monty Python came out with a DVD of all their TV shows.  I bought the record, I bought the tape, I bought the CD, I bought the book, how many versions of the Dead Parrot Sketch do I have to buy before you&#x2019;re satisfied John Cleese!!!

    <p class="description">&quot;Bring on the Funny: A Businessman's Joke Book&quot; is a compilation of jokes from my standup routine.  Using my eclectic background as a non-native, English speaking, Italian-American with a background in Anthropology, Mortgage Finance, and Business Rules, I present my jokes and witty one-liners in a format that will make you think and laugh at the same time. You will find yourself using my one-liners time and time again, sharing them with your family, friends, and business colleagues, bringing smiles to any social gathering or business presentation that you wish to use them at. <br>

    <p class="description">My parents signed me up for a temp service when I was born, and when I went in for my initial interview after college, they asked me how long I was with the company.  I told them 21 years.  So I got a plum position with one of the Big Eight accounting firms (Kansas or Kansas State, I forget which), but I got a little nervous after they began laying people off, because I wasn't really &quot;qualified&quot; for my position.  So my manager called me into his office one day and said, &quot;Giovanni, as you know, we're laying people off, but we feel your contributions to the company are too important to let you go.&quot;  So I accepted his offer for a volunteer position.  I missed the Benefits, but I got to keep my job.</p>

      <p class="notes">I was an Anthropology major in college (before I finally had to quit, too many skeletons in my closet).  As you can probably guess, I didn&#x2019;t get a lot of job offers when I graduated.  The best I could do was a night job attending market research surveys. <br>
So I tried one of those ads, &#x201c;How to make millions working from your own home.&#x201d;  And I wanted to try something different, so I started my own hospital.  I was doing so well that I started to run out of beds.  But I had to close down when the neighbors complained about the noise.  Like they never heard a siren before.<br>
I still didn&#x2019;t have enough money to pay back my school loans. You know what Sallie Mae means in Italian?  The mob.</p>

      <p class="notes">I was part of an Italian fraternity college.  We would have a toga party each year where the guy dressed as Julius Caesar would get stabbed.  &quot;Et Tu, Guido?&quot;<br>
There was this one maintenance man in college who would answer every greeting with, &#x201c;OK&#x201d;.  &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going Charlie?&#x201d;  &#x201c;OK&#x201d; &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the weather?&#x201d; &#x201c;OK&#x201d; &#x201c;Doing anything this weekend?&#x201d;  &#x201c;OK&#x201d; So one day, my buddies and I decided to greet him with an OK, before he could, to see what would happen.  So I say, OK, and he froze, and smoke started coming out of his ears, and he passed out, so we rushed him to the hospital, and when he came to, we were at his side, and he said, &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, and he recovered.</p>

      <p class="notes">St. Fenwick, as you all know, is the patron saint of money laundering. He performed the miracle of the books, where turned one set of books into two. <br>
Fenwick was a tough school. It was so tough, that the Biology Club would sponsor involuntary Blood Drives. Our cross-town rival was a charter school run by the AFL-CIO called Jackie Presser High School. We played an annual football game. You know how some rivals play for a trophy, like Purdue and Indiana play for the Old Oaken Bucket? We'd play for the Big Brown Bat.</p>

			<dd>Fenwick was different than most schools because it was a charter school run by the Teamsters. We'd have to clock in every morning. Instead of a report card, we got a timecard. In English class we learned to fill out work orders. &quot;Jimmy, can you spell requisition?&quot; In religion class, we'd study the deep issues in life, such as &quot;should garbage men wear deodorant?&quot;</dd>

      <p class="notes">When my wife and I had a tough time finding an affordable place to live, we moved in with my parents, who were in a Nursing Home at the time. We did our best to fit in, but it wasn&#x2019;t working out, so my parents moved out and bought a house using a Reverse Mortgage, which is where you buy the house outright, and the bank sends you a payment each month to buy the house back. The bank though missed some payments, so my parents started foreclosure proceedings, and won. Now they own their own bank.</p>

			<dd>When my grandpa passed away, I called this place called Funeral Home Depot to take care of the arrangements. My grandpa would have liked that, because he was a very frugal man. When he found out it would cost $400 to pay an ambulance to transport him to the hospital, he yelled at me, &#x201c;forget the respirator, I&#x2019;ll hold my breathe, take me.&#x201d; The one thing I learned is that when you buy a burial plot, you get a title to own the land, which was ironic, because my grandfather was a lifetime renter.</dd>

                &quot;How Many Clients Does It Take To Change A Lightbulb&quot; reveals the secret world of jokes that lawyers tell each other about their clients, showing that the profession has a sense of humor. The difficulties of the attorney-client relationship is shown to be not a one-sided hardship solely for clients but also for lawyers. It is a refreshing look at the practice of law from an attorney&#x2019;s perspective, the ones who are usually the butt of jokes. It serves as an awakening of the sense of humor for the all-too-serious lawyer. For the law student about to embark on the world of attorney-client relationships, it serves as a training guide by providing an insight into the personalities that clients as humans unavoidably exhibit. Without breaching the secrecy of the attorney-client relationship, this book will lighten up any discussion on law. It turns the tables on lawyer jokes and is a great stocking stuffer or gag gift for the lawyer/law student in the family.  http://www.dailycomedy.com/store
