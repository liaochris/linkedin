          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Peter Ashley&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>Peter Ashley has extensive entrepreneurial, operations, marketing and business development experience from a variety of start-ups and Fortune 1000 companies. <br>
<br>
Peter is currently the VP of BD for Mywaves, a site and service for capturing and sharing video on the web and mobile phone.<br>
<br>
Peter Ashley previously led Business Development for the PayPal Merchant Services division of eBay, which is responsible for extending the PayPal transaction platform beyond eBay, and was most recently, the GM or PayPal&#x2019;s New Media business. <br>
<br>
While at PayPal, Ashley built the foundation for the Merchant Services business unit, which Mary Meeker profiled in her January, 2005 analyst report on eBay, titled, &#x201c;The PayPal Opportunity.&#x201d;  Ashley negotiated and closed the first ever online shipping aggregation deal with UPS, which provided the foundation for eBay&#x2019;s Shipping Center.  He closed the first deal integrating PayPal into a Payment Gateway, which, Gary Craft of Financial DNA, described as, &#x201c;[helping PayPal] increasingly be viewed as the &#x201c;Visa&#x201d; of the Internet.&#x201d;  Peter started the Large Merchant Services (LMS) business by launching deals with Overstock.com (OSTK) and TigerDirect (SYX), (the first billion dollar retailers to integrate PayPal as a payment mark in their online stores) and he negotiated the deal with Apple&#x2019;s iTunes, where PayPal is a payment mark for iTunes music purchases.<br>
<br>
Prior to PayPal, Peter served as V.P. of Business Development for Audible Magic.  Ashley helped define the distribution strategy for the company's patented audio fingerprinting technology and opened relationships with Royalty Monitoring Societies, search engines and peer-to-peer distribution platforms.<br>
<br>
Peter received his MBA in 1995 from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BA from Tufts University in 1989.  He lives in Menlo Park, California with his wife and three daughters.</p>
