          <h2>Patty Therre&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I am very diverse and can write non fiction and fiction alike. I specialize in sports entertainment but I have been published in many women's magazines and have written for several other publications. I lean toward fiction as I have been very successful at it but have been writing non fiction commentary and news pieces in my current positions. If it needs to be written, I can write it. I tend to have a strong connection with my readers no matter what I write and can get points across very well without alienating readers. I am very creative and can come up with ideas and do not need to be told how to do a project. I can grasp concept and make it my own while at the same time, adhering to the guidelines given.
