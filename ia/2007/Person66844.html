                2006 League for Innovation in the Community College winner:<br>
“A Comprehensive Approach to Classroom Technology Support”<br>
 <br>
While at Monroe Community College, my Learning Resources Team was recognized for this National prestigious honor.  I was a key developer and creator of many of the systems and strategies that created an efficient and effective model for supporting faculty, staff, and students in the technology rich environments within the school.  We developed a comprehensive plan that focused on innovative approaches to staffing, technology implementation, and training.  The major elements and outcomes of this plan were: shift of responsibilities of student workers from the “AV” area to the Learning Resource Team, creation of smart classrooms, deployment of smart consoles to make “permanent portable” classrooms, piloting of PixiePro remote control system in classrooms, and faculty and staff support including Training Tracks and creation and implementation of an AV Hotline.
