            <p>Online, Web, Internet, Marketing, Search Engine Optimization, SEO and Search Engine Marketing, SEM, specialist which includes setting up Pay Per Click (PPC)  ads for clients using Yahoo Search Marketing, and Google Adwords. <br>
<br>
Simply put, I help clients get their web sites ranking at the top of the list in a search result.<br>
<br>
Your web site isn't showing up in search? Stop by my site (www.WebSearchEngineer.com) and learn why. <br>
<br>
To achieve top search results I use Bruce Clay's state-of-the-art SEOToolSet exclusively and honor his SEO Code of Ethics. I have been through his excellent training and was a staff member at his company for a short time. <br>
<br>
I'm a member in good standing of SEMPO, the Search Engine Marketing Professionals Organization(www.sempo.org). <br>
<br>
My background is in the Film, Multimedia, Web Publishing Tools, Technology Training, and Internet Marketing industries.   <br>
<br>
Technology training is another area I have extensive expertise in. I have been a trainer for over a decade focusing on web site creation tools, most notably Adobe/Macromedia Corporation&#x2019;s award winning software tools: Captivate, Dreamweaver, Flash, Director, Fireworks, Breeze, and Contribute. <br>
<br>
So far I have taught over 38,000 people how to use Macromedia's tools at over two hundred fifty schools, twenty five user groups, one hundred thirty seven companies, plus presenting at dozens and dozens of public seminars, workshops, webinars, webcast, and speaking at many industry trade shows all over the U.S. and Canada for Macromedia.<br>
<br>
Business Development comes quite naturally to me too and is also one of my major talents. I was one of Corel Corporation's Business Development Managers where I resurrected their entire Education markets within one year. <br>
<br>
I am also a classic connector of people. If you&#x2019;ve read &#x201c;The Tipping Point,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll know exactly what I mean. I maintain an ever expanding Rolodex with hundreds of people in it and constantly look for cool ways to hook people up.</p>
