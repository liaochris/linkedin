                My legal practice is now strictly limited to serving as a commercial litigation (or arbitration) neutral.  <br>

In any event, I no longer offer legal services directly to clients.  I am a full-time mediator and arbitrator, assisting parties who have legal counsel in the resolution of disputes.  Only when I am engaged in community mediation through the Los Angeles County Bar Association Dispute Resolution Services do I assist individuals without counsel in the resolution of their disputes which I do gratis as part of my professional responsibilities to provide pro bono services to those in need.

              <h3>Victoria Pynchon&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
              <p class="skills">
                My historic legal specialties were insurance coverage, antitrust, unfair competition, patent, copyright and trademark litigation, as well as the occasional securities fraud and consumer class action.  I have represented clients in the healthcare, manufacturing, garment, entertainment, insurance, finance, and banking industries.

While pursuing my own LL.M degree at Straus, I had previously guest lectured in the Institute's Negotiation and Settlement Class (on mediation confidentiality) and in its Clinical Program (on professional development).  I have also been a guest lecturer on mediation practice at the USC School of Law.  I published two academic articles while at Straus, one in the field of restorative justice (the criminal justice system's analog to mediation) and the other on the subjective meaning of money in the settlement of complex litigation.</p>

(Privately Held; 11-50 employees; Legal Services industry)<br>
<br>
January 2005 – Present (2 years 7 months) <br>
<br>
Judicate West is the Southern California ADR panel on which I serve. Other than the work I continue to do with my own ADR firm, Settle It Now, I am exclusive to Judicate West. I chose to serve on Judicate West's panel exclusively because their case managers know the skill-sets, expertise and industry as well as legal experience of all of their neutrals, whether they be retired judges or former litigators. Judicate is able to recommend which of its neutrals is best for the particular case the parties are seeking to resolve. Judicate puts its fifteen-year reputation on the line everytime it recommends one of its neutrals, not all of whom are right for every job. I trust Judicate's people, its integrity and its professionalism. I recommend Judicate when I cannot recommend my own services. Check them out and choose the neutral who is right for you.</p>

    <p class="description">I do my ADR-neutral pro bono work as a community mediator with the West Hollywood Dispute Resolution Service.  I not only derive the most fulfillment from doing this work (mediating mostly neighbor-to-neighbor and family disputes) but I am able to use the full range of my transformative mediation skills by serving my local community in this fashion.  I highly recommend to all mediators that they locate their local community, public-school-peer or victim-offender mediation programs to satisfy their professional pro bono obligation.  You will receive far more than you give.</p>

    <p class="description">I founded Settle It Now Dispute Resolution Services as soon as I learned the mediation skills necessary to help lawyers settle their commercial litigation, litigation that I had been prosecuting, defending and trying for twenty-four years.  Like too many litigators, I hated negotiating settlements and vastly preferred hand-to-hand combat in the courts.  What I didn't know was how much I would enjoy and how naturally inclined I was to negotiation once I learned the basic skills, skills I didn't pick up in 24 years of on-the-job training.  Though I am now a panelist with the Southern California ADR Services firm Judicate West, I continue to mediate (and sometimes to arbitrate) commercial disputes through Settle It Now.  My areas of expertise include insurance coverage, general commercial, patent, copyright and trademark litigation, as well as unfair competition, antitrust and consumer class action disputes.</p>

    <p class="description">While an associate (and later a partner) at Hancock (now Duane Morris) I primarily handled high-stakes environmental insurance coverage litigation, generally as lead attorney for lead counsel.  Litigating "bet the company" cases with at least a dozen co-defendants provided me with leadership and consensus building skills that are critical to my present career as a mediator (and sometime arbitrator).  While at Hancock, I also handled consumer class actions, antitrust and unfair competition cases, as well as the occasional legal malpractice action involving an attorney's for law firm's alleged negligent handling of commercial litigation.</p>

    <p class="description">I was an associate litigation attorney in the Los Angeles office of this 100+ year old Philadelphia law firm.  Though I had earlier represented a cable television company and several businesses in unfair competition and trademark infringement actions, it was here that I gained the bulk of my intellectual property experience, practicing with, among others, registered patent attorney, Les Weinstein.  While at Pepper Hamilton I played a key role in litigating to successful resolution cases in the food and beverage, consumer product and medical equipment manufacturing, entertainment, engineering, health care and commercial real estate fields.  It was also at Pepper that I gained the bulk of my experience in handling securities fraud cases and where I spent the majority of my practice in the federal courts.</p>

I also had the great good fortune to spend my externships first with Judge Alexander Williams, III, full time settlement judge for the Los Angeles Superior Court and second with Judges Carl West and Victoria Chaney in the Los Angeles Complex Court.  These co-mediation experiences with Judges gave me a judicial officer's viewpoint on the settlement and trial of commercial litigation -- a view point I had previously lacked having never served as a bench officer.</p>
