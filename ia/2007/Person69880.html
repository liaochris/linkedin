    <p class="description">We (QAIST Solutions) were engaged during the define phase of three (3) separate projects to produce 3 test strategies that would provide guidance and scope for the testing required transitioning into the design phase. The strategies were used to provide an initial costing back to the client on the testing required and resource profile(s).<br>
<br>
The 3 projects were all within the Technology Refresh Programme and included: Disaster Recovery for National Systems, Network Convergence and Mobile Workforce capabilities.<br>
<br>
The define phases for each of the three projects were based on a 5 week vigorous schedule where we had to demonstrate and identify the key product risks and provide mitigating factors to support future test design. Each of the three strategies had to undergo a commercial review which involved presenting the strategies to the Architects Design Office (ADO), the client, Project Management and Stakeholders.</p>
