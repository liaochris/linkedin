            <p>Seasoned Technology and social Entrepreneur, investor, and startup CEO. Industry expert in area of social networks, viral marketing, and user generated content.<br>
<br>
Over the past 11 years, some projects that I have been involved with as either a founder, CEO, board member, advisor or investor include Qool Media (top online auctions, loyalty solutions and direct marketing company), Freelotto (top sweepstakes &amp; direct marketing company with almost 40 million users], FreeRazor [online marketing experiment with Gillette that reached 5 million visitors and 200,000 subscribers in first 12 weeks while testing project), MedSN (leading distance learning company in medical education. www.medsn.com), Collaborative Drug Discovery - CDD (online community for scientists to share research and collaborate on drug research to solve the world's worst diseases)<br>
<br>
Since I was a student at UC Berkeley, I spent the last 14 years developing a new social entrepreneurship model for creating capital markets around social problems. My life dreams and goals are related to this work. The work I am doing today as an entrepreneur are helping me gain the experience, resources, and contacts to put in place my social entrepreneurship innovations to improve the world we live on a global level.<br>
<br>
At the same time, at a local level, I spend my free time assisting social entrepreneurs and artists with incubating smaller scale social projects.<br>
<br>
In 2003, after 10 years as an entrepreneur and startup CEO in the Silicon Valley and New York, I moved to Brazil, where I spent 3 of the most dynamic and exciting years of my life exploring my interests in social entrepreneurship, politics, dance, arts, music, international trade, and more.<br>
<br>
There I had that chance to reinvent myself, learn new skills, meet thousands of interesting personalities, learn Portuguese, improve my dance skills, build personal relationships with Brazil's young political, social, financial, business, and entertainment leaders.</p>
