          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Bruce Beswick&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I have participated in projects with Defense, Engineering, Military, Mining, Oil &amp; Gas, Logistics, Marketing, High Tech, Writing, Transportation, Ranching, Farming and many more. <br>
<br>
If the projects are different, unusual or they are a challenge - I am interested and would like to be involved. Strong generalist with a good number of contacts.<br>
<br>
Domestic and foreign capable. Planning and execution of operations. Presently involved in U.S. Army Spec Forces  training.<br>
<br>
Willing to travel anywhere at (nearly) any time to do the job.<br>
<br>
Always looking for adventure! <br>
<br>
Life is short and I try to pack as much into it as possible.<br>
<br>
My experiences have usually been in demanding situations involving the combination of people from all walks of life, machinery and equipment intensified environments including precision engineered components - prototypes, safety and testing, maintenance, operating, training, asset management. Some of this experience has been in extreme and/or hazardous locations. <br>
<br>
Success in my career can be directly attributed to the importance I place on listening, recalling information, connecting facts, putting my ideas across in an easily understood manner. I have held positions of liaison between multiple government and media agencies.<br>
<br>
The capacity to generate realistic solutions and/or to improve upon existing concepts ranks high on my inventory list. I know how to accomplish the mission &#x2013; even when working in &#x201c;unusual places&#x201d; - and I know how to keep a task(s) on target.<br>
<br>
Throughout my career I have supervised large staffs. Many of those responded to my leadership by going on and accomplishing far more than what was expected of them as they progressed through their own careers.</p>
