    <p class="description">Due to the sensitive nature of some of the projects I am currently working on, I am a little wary about posting full details here at this point.  I can disclose some of the more &quot;generic&quot; things, though.<br>
<br>
I am currently working in a postition as a PHP developer for a very high traffic website.  I have continued to apply my skills at this job by using some of the techniques I have learned at past jobs, including:<br>
<br>
- Creating a debugging framework and embedding it in some parts of our system. The end result is a single point in the code that I can &quot;toggle&quot; to turn on all sorts of detailed output.  This is useful when working on another team member's code.<br>
<br>
- Creating a logging framework (and the UI) to log unusual events.  This has already proven to be worth the time I spent writing it, as a co-worker put calls to the framework in various parts of his code that deleted unused files.  <br>
<br>

    <p class="description">The Save Ardmore Coalition is a 501(c)4 civic group based out of Ardmore, PA.  It was originally founded to fight a bogus &quot;blight&quot; designation on several local businesses and received national media coverage.  <br>
<br>
I was brought on to maintain and expand the group's website.  I migrated the existing content to the Drupal Content Management System and made use of Drupal's many built in modules to add support for blogs and forums to the website.  This caused the website to grow exponentially from a dozen pages at the time to 1,300+ pages and blog entries today.  This has had the result of giving our members a way to stay active through blogging and participating in the site's forums.</p>

    <p class="description">Anthrocon, Inc. is a 501(c)7 non-profit registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  My specific role is running the organization's Operations Department, with a staff of 6 to 8 individuals reporting to me.  This department is responsible for logistics and support of other departments before, during, and after our 2,500 person yearly convention in Pittsburgh, PA.  <br>
<br>
During the convention itself, the Operations Office acts as the &quot;nerve center&quot; and is used as a central point of contact for our members, the hotel, and our security force.  We also oversee cash handling and act as a dispatch point for volunteers.<br>
<br>
Additional responsibilities that I have include acting as SysAdmin for our web and mail server, and running the organization's web site.  In 2006, I migrated the website from a series of custom written scripts to the Drupal Content Management System.  This enables staff members to directly update parts of the website that relate to their department.</p>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">As the SysAdmin, I was responsible for management of our mail, web, and DNS servers.  I installed and confgured software, dealt with intrusion attempts, made backups, did seamless migration from one network to another, and generally kept things running. Where needed, I wrote custom Perl or PHP code as &quot;glue&quot; to make pre-existing software work the way we wanted it to.<br>
<br>
What's even more interesting about my work with SpamCon is that I did it all from 3,000 miles away.  The servers were on the West Coast while I was on the East Coast.  I handled all of the necessary tasks remotely, and only needed &quot;remote hands&quot; for the occasional fsck prompt after a reboot.</p>

My responsibilities included working on a significant part of the front-end web interface, as well as maintaining the packaging scripts for the PHP code and our Apache installation.<br>
<br>
I also continued to maintain &quot;railgun&quot;, the testing software that I first wrote when working for TurnTide.<br>
<br>
I also spent some time working with Selenium, a Javascript based application which can be used to test the front end of websites by simulating clicks and data entry, and checking the results of any action.</p>

    <p class="description">In the 3 months that I spent at TurnTide (before being bought by Symantec), I worked on two significant projects.  The first project was &quot;railgun&quot;, a Python application which I built on top of the Twisted Python async I/O framework.  Its job was to send as much email (both &quot;ham&quot; and &quot;spam&quot;) as fast as it could, to test our anti-spam network appliance.<br>
<br>
The second project I built was a C module which ran suspect email through a series of regular expressions and scored it based on how well it matched (if it matched at all).  While on this project, I also built a testing system to simulate email traffic as well as a debugging system through the use of pre-processor directives.</p>

My first major project was the development of an Apache/PHP/MySQL backend system that did the following: billing, customer service, account management, and affiliate tracking and payouts.  After this was completed, I spent the next 2 years maintaining the system and adding features to streamline work for our affiliates, sales force, and customers.</p>

During that timeframe I also migrated our website from a Microsoft ASP-based system to a PHP system, and wrote a membership management system in PHP that utilized a MySQL database and required members to &quot;double opt-in&quot; to join the organization.</p>

This job was also my first experience with SQL, I and ended up taking well to Oracle and filling the role of the DBA there.  I used my expertise to implement some best practices, such as moving all of our users into separate tablespaces, analyzing all complex queries (and creating a web-based application to assist with that), and implementing daily reporting on tablespace and account usage and trends.</p>
