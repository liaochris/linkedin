We will have to reduce our Western living and total existing costs with minimal 50%! In the Far East people today work and live on a quart of our living costs. As we go on in time - but sooner than we think - they will rise and about double their cost structures. Even if this scenario would in existence today, how are  we to compete, with our innovative industries lost...?<br>
