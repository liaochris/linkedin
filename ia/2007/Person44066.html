    <p class="description">When Ursula Wolf became a partner at NetVenture Deutschland, she also took over the General Management duties.<br>
As a partner in translations companies in Austria, Germany, France and Italy, I started to develop a networked organization being able to respond to needs of larger customers. We added partners in Greece and Poland and created a structure where all partners could benefit of technology advances within the group.<br>
During this period, all partners in the network grew and we added prestigious customers like SAS, Adobe, Toshiba, etc.<br>
My resonsibilities were to manage the network and support the development of tools and processes as a service to all partner companies.<br>
In early 2005, the network was re-structured: LinguaNet AG in Austria was created as a holding company, it took over the companies in France, Italy, Germany and Poland as 100% affiliates, and a new, strong management structure was created to manage the growth of LinguaNet as an organization and as a brand.</p>

    <p class="description">From Italy my family moved to Munich, Germany because my wife wanted to attain a Heilpraktiker school and we wanted our daughter to attend the European school in Munich helping her to develop her trilingual skills.<br>
As I had already done so twice, I re-started a local translation company mainly for large localization projects (Sybase, IBM, etc.). We grew and in September 1997, Ursula Wolf joined the team. In 1998, she joined NetVenture as a partner.<br>
Due to the new relations we found in the medical community, the company extended its offer to specialized medical translations.</p>

    <p class="description">Moving from Paris to Lari in Tuscany, Italy, I worked from home as a translator for Interlingua, ILS Paris and a number of customers like Dataid (that became later AT&T Istel, AT&T, Berlitz, Bowne, today merged into Lionbridge, No.1 in the world-wide translation market).<br>
During this time, I participated in large software localization projects at Digital Equipment in Sophia Antipolis, mostly software and help into German. DEC had an urgent need for Eastern European languages after the iron curtain fell. Almost naturally, I started to organize those languages (Slovakian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Russian) for them. A company called LinguaNet PassWord was created in Paris to manage these localization projects. I became a co-owner of LNPW. Due to my activities, LNPW then started to work for IBM SMS, Kodak, SPSS and others.<br>
I also started an Italian business with a partner. It later became NetVenture Italia and was taken over as LinguaNet Italia by LinguaNet AG in 2005.</p>

    <p class="description">Interlingua Translations of Vienna wanted to expand to France and I was offered a 50/50 partnership to build a translation office in Paris from scratch.<br>
I started a highly challenging mission in my life: Almost no funds, a 28 m2 office/apartment, but plenty of experience, a strong desire to create something and nothing to loose.<br>
Now, being an entrepreneur, I used the experience I had gained during all the years: Financial, marketing, sales, translation production, technical infrastructure. I went out and looked for customers. After 1,5 years, we had grown to 7 people and worked for big names in the French industry.<br>
I registered the LinguaNet brand because I had a vision that one day, all the dots will be connected.<br>
Then I met my wife, we had a child and I decided to take a break.</p>

    <p class="description">Interlingua Translations Vienna, completely separated from the UK, had a new owner who asked me to join the team as marketing manager, responsible for customer relations in Vienna and the new affiliate office in Munich, Germany. At this time, the first PCs were introduced to the market and Interlingua became an early adopter of text processing and data transmission processes.<br>
We developed text processing software on Philips 2000 machines for Arabic and Russian, a central file server for freelance translators, as well as an interface to the Hell typesetting system which allowed for direct transfer of translated text (also in Russian and Arabic) to the electronic typesetting machine.<br>
I created the brand "LinguaNet" to promote this new, innovative approach in translation processing to the customers, the press and the general public.<br>
During this time, I also learned how to cold call a prospect, work through the sales process until the closure with customers in Austria and Germany.</p>

    <p class="description">After the takeover of Airtour, Touropa Austria grew with many new destinations. I joined the headquarters as contract manager for Tunisia, Marocco, Egypt and France. My responsibilities were negotiations of allotments in hotels, preparation of an excursions programme, authoring the hotel descriptions for the main brochure and trouble shooting in case of surbookings. I also participated in a series of seminars for travel agency employees to promote my destinations.<br>
In parallel, I worked for the tour guide department organizing trainings for new tour guides, managing the financial aspects of the 50+ team of expatriated guides and visiting the destinations (financial audits, motivation of expatriates).<br>
A great time with a great team. I learned a lot about contract negotiations in a very different cultural environment, about the strange group dynamics in a highly dispersed team as well about the secrets of marketing (brochure, presentation, sales pitches, presentations).</p>

    <p class="description">In 1974, Interlingua Translation was created as the Austrian affiliate of Interlingua Translations of East Grinstead, Sussex, UK. (While the Austrian affiliate became independent, the British company merged with TTI, this was taken over by Alpnet, and Alpnet was later taken over by SDL, today second largest translation company worldwide.)<br>
I joined the company shortly after its creation and had to develop everything from scratch: Processes, customers, resources.<br>
Initially, it was a part-time position that I held parallel to my studies and activities in the cultural sector, but it developed quickly into a highly demanding occupation where I learned almost everything about how to run a company. I left the company (then a 7 people operation and No.1 on the Austrian translation market) when I was offered a position as Regional representative of Touropa Austria in Tunisia.</p>
