              &quot;If a career or business does not support your lifestyle of choice, can it really be called successful?&quot;<br>
<br>
Megan Fitzgerald is a career, business and personal branding strategist and the founder of Career By Choice. She helps internationally minded professionals, entrepreneurs and expats use their unique value to build a career or business that fits who they are and their lifestyle of choice.<br>
<br>
Having self-designed a rewarding career and business that supports her lifestyle, Megan takes an entrepreneurial approach to help others find the same flexibility and freedom in their work that she enjoys. She thinks and plays 'outside-the-box' and invites her clients to do the same. With her creative, strategic and supportive style, Megan empowers others to leverage their strengths, explore possibilities and make choices resulting in a more fulfilling professional life.<br>
<br>
She draws from over 15 years of experience in career development, business development and international education and training. She has worked with professionals and entrepreneurs all over the world, having been to over 20 countries to live, work or play. Megan has designed, managed and evaluated small business training programs for entrepreneurs from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. She also designed and managed career development programs for university students from across the globe. Most recently, she worked with individuals and communities in the U.S. and Africa facing challenges as a result of HIV and AIDS.<br>
<br>
Founding Career By Choice allowed Megan to combine her expertise in career and business development and her passion for helping others to overcome challenges to improve the quality of their personal and professional lives.<br>
<br>
When she is not being of service to her clients, Megan is nurturing her creative nature through art and film, feeding her spirit of adventure with travel and dancing, and satiating her strong sense of curiosity with meditation and learning.
