          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Duncan Work&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I'm an entrepreneur with experience in business development, marketing strategy, development of effective business models, and software development.  I'm a designer and inventor of social and collaborative software.   Much of my previous work has involved design of social networking functionality that enables more intelligent brokering of relationships and user-controlled access to private information.   In addition to managing many aspects of starting companies, I also have extensive experience in consulting with software developers and end users; and I have experience in international trade consulting and hands-on trade.<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in the social effects of software and technology, especially those that can help individuals think, plan and collaborate more effectively in groups and organizations.  I have a background in anthropology, urban affairs and sociology; and strong interests in international development, social and business transformation, and the study of intelligence, including intelligent agent technologies and applications of networked intelligence in groups.</p>
