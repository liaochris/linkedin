            <p class="skills">
              I have multiple IBM and HP certifications and a long history of IT experience, and I love all things geeky, but I'm more of a big picture and strategy person than the guy who sits and codes for days on end. I prefer to work on the design, writing, and usability ends of the project.<br>

    <p class="description">I managed a team providing corporate training; supervising quality programs; administrating broad aspects of the company&#x2019;s ISO 9002 accreditation (very similar to accreditation compliance and institutional effectiveness in academia); and performing workload efficiency analysis for prospective and existing major contracts. I developed training curriculum; created presentations; participated on the executive presentation team for major contract acquisition; performed quality and performance audits; wrote sections of the corporate operations manual; and authored a study that led to entering a new market segment (education). I interacted with senior executives for customers including FedEx, the United Nations, Boeing, and major branches of the U.S. Govt.<br>
<br>
--- I provided ongoing consulting for six months after leaving, helping manage the rollout of new telcom and data infrastructure to offices throughout the U.S. I worked closely with Sprint, Bellsouth, Nortel, Lucent, Cisco, and Qwest.</p>

    <p class="description">Managed Novell network with 18 local users and 35 dial-in users. Wrote software for  time collection application.  The system collected time and job data frorm remote locations, providing management reports to account managers and upper management, as well as to customers. This system handled payroll calculations for over 2000 employees.<br>
<br>
Wrote automated quality control system utilizing MS Access, Visual Basic, and a Paschal-like language to write code for hand-held data collection devices like those used by FedEx (Microwand IIIe by HandHeld Products).  The system allowed account managers in large commercial office buildings (250,000 to 1,500,000 sq ft) to place bar codes in door frames of tenants with which they associated quality control data in the database. The devices prompted managers to scan barcodes and answer customer-specific quality prompts. The program also included a 28 point inspection for each area associated with a barcode.</p>

Thesis: &#x201c;Remediation, Genre, and Blogs: A Reexamination of Blogs as Genre.&#x201d; Starting with Carolyn Miller&#x2019;s theories of genre and rhetorical hierarchy and proceeding to Miller&#x2019;s examination of blogging as genre, co-authored with Dawn Shepherd, I argue that blogging is not in and of itself a new genre, but a complex of emergent technologies that together form a new medium. The blog as medium supports numerous genres: personal diary blogs, citizen journalist blogs, and corporate blogs to name a few.
