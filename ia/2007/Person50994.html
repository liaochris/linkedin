<br>
We teach kids between the ages of 7 and 18, and we give instruction in<br>
guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and vocal.  The Paul Green School of Rock is a performance-based program -- while the private lessons cover a great deal of ground in terms of musical theory and basic techniques, the core of the program is preparation for live performance.  At the end of every twelve-week season, each<br>
student participates in a show at a major live music venue in San <br>
Diego.  <br>
