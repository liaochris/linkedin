    <p class="description">Hays hired me to set up an Architecture function within their IT division and to head up that function during its initial phases.  My duties included:<br>
&#x2022;	Development of Framework Architectures.<br>
&#x2022;	Consulting to business on technology.<br>
&#x2022;	Implementation of an IT Architecture Board.<br>

&#x2022;	Consulting to architecture teams.<br>
&#x2022;	Development of technical architecture.<br>
&#x2022;	Consulting on technical issues.<br>
This role involved utilising my architectural skills to start an Architecture function within Hays IT division.  This was intended to stabilise the delivery of IT while providing reusability, transparency and efficiency gains.  Several industry standard frameworks such as TOGAF and Zachman were used in a cut down form to provide these benefits while pragmatic management and creation of artefacts and a light weight architecture board means that benefits were gained out of the introduction of formal architecture without loosing agility.</p>
