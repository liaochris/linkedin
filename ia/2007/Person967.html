              <p>MANAGEMENT STYLE<br>
&#x2022; Follows own intuition, unless radically opposes the objectives<br>
&#x2022; Open to new challenges, takes calculated risks<br>
&#x2022; Drives new initiatives to sustainable success<br>
&#x2022; Commits to change / improvement at all times<br>
&#x2022; Prefers people presenting alternative solutions, rather then the problem alone<br>
&#x2022; Motivates people through recognizing their limitations, performing towards those boundaries, ultimately setting the borders to higher potentials.<br>
<br>
LEADERSHIP STYLE<br>
Build teams, which empower others to exceed their goals.  Leading teams across continents formed skills in diversity awareness and performance mgmt.<br>
Assumes a tone of direct command, shows a lot of self-confidence and the ability to keep a lot of projects going at the same time.<br>
Makes quick decisions and wants fast and accurate results. Strives for a perfect solution through hands-on collaboration with all levels of the organisation. Takes-on extra responsibilities and delegates authority when necessary.</p>
