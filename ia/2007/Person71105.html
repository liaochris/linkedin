Stock/commodities/derivative trading in indian market, now learning forex trading to earn in international currency & bullion market.It's my hobby as it's a fun with potential earnings much more than any job, like to do market analysis & research to find best suitable stock/commodity/derivative, time to buy/sell and most important fullfil the demand to my satisfation and has potential to provide financial freedom & life security in combination with my other businesses mentioned above, Income is much more than work done & time spent, allows me to handle my other businesses mentioned above after trading hours and gives mr capital to invest in new business opportunites in their development, publishing, marketing & advertising/promotions. Today private Jobs are totally insecured and unreliable as they runs on cheap nonsense politics under peoples who knows how to exploit the innocence & to recognise right fool to do it for them based on suppression for leading in own org. or local network instead of self business development as a team for leading among world competitors.

My Previous activity was done blindly under a technical infatuation made by clever minds to exploit my innocence &amp; lack of life experiences in this greedy &amp; cruel world,  worked for other's on the cost of ruining my own life &amp; precious time, so decided to learn the language of self development, greediness &amp; cruelty for survival &amp; leading, my present activity is not at all related to vlsi and all stuff related to it &amp; nor having any interest in it to do as it's highly fluctuating field, project cost &amp; expenses to setup is too much higher &amp; liable to loose the inveted amount, project execution time required is big that i can't afford investment capital &amp; sophesticated engg. technology specialists requires that has high NRE costs most liable to bear the loss because of higher expenses n nre cost than profit margin. And to live my life fully according to me as i like.</p>
