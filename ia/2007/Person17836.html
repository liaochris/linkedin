    <p class="description">The World Café is a dialogic process used around the world in a wide variety of sectors; it is a loosely affiliated, self-directed network of people and organizations using the World Café process.<br>
 <br>
My work has been to help create a virtual infrastructure to support the complex needs of this constantly emergent and evolving multi-lingual, multi-cultural network.<br>
<br>
To this end I have initiated and continue to collaboratively develop a constellation of online communication vehicles that include: a central website with global directory and international event calendar; conversational forum and resource repository; a StoryNet; four blogs (covering regional, philosophical, climate change and overall network community  issues); two wikis, a photographic gallery and a network-wide newsletter.<br>
<br>
Two of the current projects I'm most excited about are creating the precise conditions for an online World Cafe and opening a virtual World Café headquarters in Second Life.</p>

<br>
Volunteer Coordination - I managed volunteer development programs and supervised volunteer teams of up to 150 people.<br>
<br>
Art Direction - My particular interest was in integrating art and science and I initiated and managed several large-scale pubic environmental art installations.<br>

I co-owned a restaurant/bar in Brighton, UK - The Blue Parrot - between 1986 & 1992, for which I designed and built the kitchen, created the menu, and then trained and supervised the kitchen and floor staff. I also managed the payroll, taxes, and other accounting.<br>

Before that I helped open the vegetarian restaurant Kung Food in San Diego, CA, where I collaboratively designed the menu, cooked, waitressed, managed the floor staff and had a lot of fun for 2 years.</p>
