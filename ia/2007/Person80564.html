          <h2>Simon Newman&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I am currently a Project Manager at PassAlong Networks (www.passalongnetworks.com), a music-technology company based in Franklin, TN.  PassAlong is an innovator of music-related technologies, providing solutions such as fully-branded music download stores, Connected Consumer solutions, and MP3-enabling DRM's.  I am currently project managing a major Joint Venture combining the music and advertising sectors.  I also have been leading sales activities with promotions/advertising agencies.<br>
<br>
I currently live in Nashville, TN, where I moved to as my wife is completing her Pediatric Residency at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital.  We came to Nashville from San Antonio, where I worked for Rackspace Managed Hosting, a technology company that has experienced explosive growth.  While at Rackspace, I learned the value of doing whatever it takes for the customer, and the importance of an organization to be both customer and employee focused.  I was able to move up and have many different experiences at Rackspace, including managing one of our customer care teams for the Enterprise Division, and being an Account Manager leading the relationship with some of the company's largest and most complex accounts.  I also helped to lead the team for the Enterprise division that was managing an implementation of the Onyx CRM.  While at Rackspace, I won their &quot;Fanatic&quot; award for exemplary performance, and I also got mentioned in an article in &quot;FastCompany&quot; magazine (http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/83/open_cuckoo.html).  <br>
<br>
I went to school at The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, where I got a BSBA at the Kenan Flagler Business School, a top 10 undergraduate program nationally.  <br>
<br>
I also worked for 1.5 years with Healthstream (www.healthstream.com), a leading healthcare e-learning company in Nashville.  While there, I managed relationships with some of their largest, most complicated accounts, including Tenet, Sutter, Baxter, Roche, Cardinal Health, and Medtronic.
