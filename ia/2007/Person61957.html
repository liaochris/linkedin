              <h3>Marc Carroll&#8217;s Honors:</h3>
              <p class="honors">
                Under my direction for the IBM catalog, my team secured the number 2 catalog position world-wide for four years in a row,... 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 as published by Catalog Age Magazine. This ranking covered all catalogs published in the US, for all industries.<br>
<br>
Dell Computer Corp came in as the only direct catalog to beat us in terms of sales for those three years. <br>
