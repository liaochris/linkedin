As of now, I am creating companies involved in the e/Mini/Entrepreneurial realm (eBay, eCommerce overall, IT consultations, business online integration, media and "vortals"). I wish to attend an Ivy League accredited college such as MIT for graduate school and receive an MBA in Entrepreneurship, Innovation and the Development of Business Ideas. Following my MBA, I hope to either start-up new companies or stay at MIT and receive a PhD in Marketing, Business Psychology or Technology and Entrepreneurship. I then wish to enter into the sector of Nanotechnology, the future scientific revolution. I would be interested in the business aspect of this field, and how the products created using Nanotechnology may be marketed and purchased by consumers. During this time, I hope to build companies that are innovative and cutting edge - the industry leaders in Nanotechnology.</p>
