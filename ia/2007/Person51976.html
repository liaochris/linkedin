            <h2>Lon Adams&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                During the last two years as CEO of a venture capital funded software company, I restructured the company, hired a new management team, focused our strategy and product offering and we increased sales by over 35% last year.  As a result of the heavy travel demands (spending two weeks in Irvine, California followed by two weeks in Paris, France plus other domestic and international travel), I recently decided it was time to make a change and promoted the COO into my former position as CEO.  I remain Chairman of the company but am now in a position to consider a new opportunity. <br>
<br>
Citilog is a software company headquartered in Paris, France with regional offices in Philadelphia and Hong Kong and doing business worldwide. The company&#x2019;s software adds intelligence to video surveillance systems by monitoring the video streams and automatically generating alerts from predefined triggering events. <br>
<br>
In previous positions at Fortune 100 companies, I delivered highly profitable results as Vice President, Strategy and then heading an E-Business Product Management group.  As a CEO I have experience working with those in executive management and managing budgets and staff.  My MBA is from a top school and I have both a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI) and a Six Sigma Green Belt certification.  Having proven myself in both tough-minded entrepreneurial environments and Fortune 100 companies, I am confident that I can deliver the leadership, project and general management experience that your company needs.
