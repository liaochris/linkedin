            <h2>Jesse Miller&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                My major is biochemistry.  I have put in long hours of school to become proficient with laboratory procedures and techniques.  I have future plans to enter medical school and become a physician.<br>
<br>
Before I began my formal schooling in biochemistry, I was a certified Solaris Systems Administrator, and certified Pharmacy Technician.  My computer skills are prime, as are my customer service skills in the areas of business analyst work.<br>
<br>
I am searching for an undergraduate laboratory research program of chemistry, biology, or biochemistry study.  I believe that my current skills as well as my former professional skills as a technical analyst, business analyst, computer programmer, and systems administrator would make me an invaluable asset to any research team.<br>
<br>
I need only 6 hours of undergraduate lab research to complete my degree, but I am willing to put in more hours if necessary.

    <p class="description">Ayopah (in Greek it means marketplace) is an online shopping mall that anybody can create for themselves. ABSOLUTELY FREE! <br>
<br>
While shopping through your Ayopah mall, you get to things:<br>
<br>
You get a discount on any merchandise you choose *and* you get CASH BACK on each and every item you purchase through Ayopah.<br>
<br>
This could be from Walmart, Sears, Circuit city, The Sharper Image, Starbucks, and Ayopah has a collection of stores where you can find items that you just can't find anywhere else!<br>
<br>
Start you own Ayopah mall just for yourself, then get everybody you know to create their own mall. When they shop, you get a percentage of every purchase they make!<br>

<br>
The perfect vehicle for the 21st century entrepreneur is within the deregulated electricity industry market (new to Texas, other states are also following this trend).<br>
<br>
Ignite has created an avant-garde entry method of distribution which allows the independent distributor to build a powerful ownership of the business while at the same time offering a great service representing a Top-5 tier electric service provider.<br>

For more information, visit: www.jlmelectric.com.  Or call me directly at my home or mobile numbers - or just send an email if you would like more information about the business.  We need skilled and intelligent entrepreneurs.  You don't have to be a salesman - but you do have to reach out to people - just like I'm doing right now.  That's it.  Easy, but it makes money.  Seriously.<br>
