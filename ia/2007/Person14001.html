            <h2>Byrne Hobart&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                My experience is pretty scattered, since I'm currently in the process of turning value investing and financial writing from a full-time hobby to a full-time job. Briefly, I've been investing for years, I've worked at one financial job and a few other administrative jobs, and I've read a ridiculous number of financial statements and business books. I write a financial weblog (http://marketview.blogspot.com), and alternate between looking for work in the hedge fund industry and looking for interesting stocks and trends.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty far along the Graham/Fisher/Buffet/John Burr Williams/KKR/Carl Icahn school of in-depth fundamental analysis and (when possible) controlling positions in undervalued companies. Unfortunately, I don't precisely have funding to match my ambitions, so the best success I can point to is someone else making a killing with an idea I had first: In late 2003, I wrote a report on Blair Corp (Amex: BL), noting that the company was underperforming and undervalued, and suggesting that this was because management wasn't sufficiently terrified of shareholders. My suggestion was to buy 5-10% of the stock, and force management to 1) Dump their consumer credit division, 2) Stop hoarding cash, 3) Buy back a huge chunk of stock, and 4) Get rid of their Internet division (&#xe1; la Wired Online -- same content, different owner). I saw a pile of cash and mismanaged assets; the market saw a low-end mail-order retailer with a few unused and unuseful appendages. I passed my report on to a financially-savvy and financially-connected people; they passed on the plan but commended the effort.<br>
<br>
A few months later, a hedge fund I've never heard of bought a 13-D-worthy stake, and convinced management to put plans 1 through 3 into effect (4 was, in retrospect, a bad idea -- delusions of 90's grandeur, I suppose). I'm not sure how much they made, but it looked like about a 30% return over two or three months, which is not exactly paltry.

              <p class="skills">
                Alliteration, identifying balance sheet problems, small cap stocks, value investing, touting stocks that deserve to be touted, esoteric stocks (some of my biggest winners have been: A licorice company, a Mexican chicken company, and NASDAQ -- most of whose shareholders didn't seem to realize that their company was even public until the NASDAQ started trading it), financial soundbites, economic history

    <p class="description">Due to litigious and overregulated nature of the financial world, I did *not* do investment research, nor did I give advice or recommendations. On the contrary! Things I wrote about stocks were for entertainment purposes only, 'recommendations' -- which were not recommendations -- could be followed only at the reader's discretion, and as an entertainer who happened to attempt to be entertaining people by discussing the merits and demerits of various common stocks, I was of course in the position of investment-discusser, not investment-advisor. However, had someone been so foolish as to take my word as gospel and buy stocks on the basis of statements I made regarding those stocks, such an investor would have beaten the indices by quite a lot. Lucky investor!</p>

<br>
*Note that this was a very part-time job; two and a half years worked should not imply anything like two and a half years of actual experience. On the other hand, I did even more annual report- and 10-Q- and proxy-reading in my spare time, so adjust estimations of expertise accordingly.</p>
