            <p>I believe that self-consciousness and being 'present' (Tolle) is the first step towards true individual creativeness but also to collective strategic thinking and Leadership. Therefore I have created the Open Networkers (website link above) movement for people who want to join me towards that goal.<br>
<br>
I advise and coach people to communicate and network effectively on Web 2.0 and web 3.0 in order to create a global network of strategic and creative thinkers with their own models and ideas comparative to mine above.<br>

- &#x201c;It is my pleasure to endorse Ray who is an experienced professional and leading networker. I have enjoyed his support and would recommend his services to all.&#x201d; <br>
Arnnei Speiser<br>
<br>
&#x201c;I had the honor of meeting Ray through the Open Networkers group he created. He is always miles ahead of everyone else when it comes to the next big thing. He had the vision to create open networkers, when everyone else was just starting to use linkedin. Now he is working on web 2.0, while the rest of us are still on 1.0. I highly recommend connecting with Ray.&#x201d; Chris Williams<br>
<br>
 &#x201c;Ray has the unique strategic value as a business consultant not only knowing how to analyze many different company-expertises and processes, but he actively helps managing them towards Earned Value. He finds solutions, matches competences and helps to train communication skills in the modern networking society. I can highly recommend him as a result-driven professional.&#x201d; Peter Luiks</p>
