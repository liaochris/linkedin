                The mission of Wings4u2fly is to help people in business increase their effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Achievements that I am particularly proud of:<br>
<br>
--- Trained the entire UK senior management team of a global company in leadership skills with phenomenal real-world results.  I made it easy and effortless for the delegates to make the internal shifts needed to become truly inspiring leaders.<br>
<br>
--- Played an important role in the Cable & Wireless Infrastructure Stabilisation & Transformation programme.<br>
<br>
--- Among the first 370 people in the UK to achieve coveted Microsoft MCSE status from a standing start in record time by working 20 hours a day, 7 days a week for 3 months solid.<br>
<br>
--- Nominated for European award for excellence during time as a Senior Trainer at Digital Equipment Corporation because I made things easy and fun for the delegates even with the most horrendously complex topics.<br>
<br>
I have inbuilt diversity, which you can see from my eclectic background below.
