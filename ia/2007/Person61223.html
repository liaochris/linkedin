A peak into my mind: The internet is great, but in my opinion, It will never take over the world as some have suggested. Instead, I envision a time when people will be more connected than ever, have richer human to human experiences, and do business in an entirely different way than today.  In all honesty, I don't know exactly where we will be as a society 20 year from now, but one thing is for sure, the internet will be as integrated into our lives in the future as automobiles are today!

      <p class="notes">I obtained by bachelors degree in Criminal Justice Administration in 2004. Being an intelligence, cryptology and numbers geek, I opted to stay in school after graduating in order to pursue my Masters in Business Administration. Thoughts of a career in counter intelligence or law enforcement soon dissipated as I was introduced to the world of internet business. In this industry I have found a place where I can crunch numbers until my heart is satisfied, but more importantly, make sense of them in a way that is applicable and lucrative for current web business owners as well as those who are dabbling with the idea of starting an online business. <br>
<br>
The University of Phoenix was a great resource for education, experience and contacts, all while holding down a full time job, paying the bills and working through the college years.</p>

Not all is lost, the government recently moved the age a person can enter the agencies from 37 to 45! This makes so much sense, it is shocking it did not happen sooner. Whoo-hooo, I may still get there.</p>

      <p class="notes">One of the things I realized when I entered this industry is that although I had just graduated and received my MBA, in order to be successful and effective I would need to jump right back into school. <br>
<br>
Since starting with SEO, I have jumped from one learning program to another in order to stay on the cutting edge of web marketing. Some have been extremely insightful and some have been smoke screens. Through this process, I have identified what I feel are the top dogs in the industry. From SEO (Bruce Clay) to market research (Elliot Gluskin) to Market Intelligence (Russel Wright), and all the other gurus, the idea is to be tapped into the heartbeat of the industry, something these folks achieve while being completely ethical and setting the standards for the industry. <br>
