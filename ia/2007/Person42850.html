TBiC provides outsourced accounts payable services for SMEs &amp; corporates, with high transaction volumes.  Marketed direct, &amp; through service providers, we share profits, &amp; support sales &amp; account managers with a reliable rapidly delivered service.<br>
<br>
Typically invoice processing costs &#xa3;5 - 25/invoice.  The largest cost is often people.  TBiC invoice transaction processing costs &#xa3;1/item or less.  Achieved entirely electronically over the web (usually) without offshore or traditional BPO intervention. We don't loose or screw up transactions &amp; we cater for all sorts of systems from simple web based invoicing, through to sophisticated ERP &amp; FINANCIALS systems.  We service big names in the retail sector, where invoice volumes tend to be high, values &amp; margins low &amp; processing overheads can wipe out profit.<br>
<br>
Our ROI tool calculates new-cost against current cost &amp; shows pay back within a year, with the ability for customers to reduce AP staff by 80-95%.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>CIO / ICT Director</h3>      <p><strong>www.mineseeker.com</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Non-Profit; 11-50 employees; Environmental Services industry)</p>  <p>            November 2005         &#8211; Present        (1 year 3 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Not-for-profit and committed to improvement in technology for humanitarian mine action to reduce the social and economic impact of landmines, the scourge of the modern world. <br>
