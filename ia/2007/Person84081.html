            <h2>Tamara R Pearlman, CPC&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have been working in both tangible and in-tangibles sales all of my life. I have been an Executive Recruiter for the past 14+ years, with my forte for most of those years in building practices for the former Big 6, IBM and other Tier 2 and 3 firms.  We have been primarily technology focused, with a strong emphasis in placement of Executives and Sales personnel. <br>
<br>
Technology & Executive Resourcing expertise in building practices for firms such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Accenture, Arthur Andersen, E&Y, KPMG, IBM and Medtronics  Aided many pre-IPO go public. Executive Placement on all levels, BDMs and Sales personnel in a variety of industries. Further background in Off Shore, BPO, CRM, ERP, EC, BI, and more. <br>
<br>
I provided a number of corporations with training in Process Refinement in the recruitment process. In-house recruiters and hiring managers are so bogged down with their work load that they are unable to respond in a timely manner to candidates in the process.  The best way to hire a candidate is to streamline the process so that your firm is assured of hiring the best and the brightest in the market place. We at Endeavor Group can aid you in doing this! <br>
<br>
Technology & Executive Resourcing<br>

We also provide contract services in both the IT Recruiting, SCM Financials and Medical Recruiting divisions. I look at every facet of business on your behalf.<br>
<br>

    <p class="description">Recruited by the founder of Noll Human Resource Services to found their Dallas office. I came on board to build their IT Division from the bottom up.  I was charged with building the database, new business development, recruiting and training recruiters for the IT Division, while working a desk managing both candidates and clients.<br>
This was a great opportunity for me and I will be forever grateful for the ability to expand my horizons via this firm in the recruitment arena. I worked with both the internal recruiters, as well as networked with key external recruiters, to keep multiples revenue streams flowing into the Dallas office. I learned to work in  logistics and medical recruiting arena, while there which has been invaluable to me.<br>
After almost five years of commuting 50 miles round trip in Dallas traffic, I decided it was time to work at home, while raising a young son by myself.  I bid Noll Human Resource Services farewell and began the next chapter in my life as a recruiter.</p>

    <p class="description">I began this business to get my hands on a computer and learn more about technology.  I began as a receptionist working for temp agencies, and worked my way up to my own firm, contracting myself out to such firms as IBM, where I contracted for 4.5 years here in the DFW area, and Motorola where I contracted for 18 months.<br>
While at both firms I learned GML known today as HTML, and learned to program in C on a Unix platform.  I aided Motorola's training group in building a student database.  I helped to refine the search parameters to make the database more user friendly.  I also aided students in enrollment in classes, and learned what I set out to do, and that was technology.<br>
When looking for new contracts I went to CTG, where I was recruited to become a recruiter.  I was one of the founding recruiters of CTG's National Staffing Center based in Dallas.  While CTG was not the firm for me, I did find a new love, and that was recruiting.  And that is how I stumbled into my 4th career!</p>
