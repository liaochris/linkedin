            <p>Freethinker, Deist, Universist &amp; self-styled Social Entrepreneur. Friends call me AL. I observe change and analyze patterns to find out future opportunities and social/market gaps hidden to traditional (desi) business policy/thought centers. simultaneously scanning multiple industries and schools of thought brings the broadness of understanding of what is going on around.. for 5 yrs now i am inspired, excited and enthralled with the magnanimous change coming up. every thing that we know is about to change.<br>
<br>
Sadly, in Pak we're still entwined in the centuries old dogmas and biases. this MUST change and im at it. its a whole new world where the change is accelerating at phenomenal rate. our age old beliefs and attitudes are no longer applicable and productive. today's mantra for success is technology (not just adopting but aggressively creating and affecting new technologies) <br>
<br>
Internet is the medium of future and i strongly believe that any nation that wants to survive in the coming age must leverage the internet to the fullest.<br>
<br>
Internet is my passion and mission is to create highest impact positive social change through internet. for this i need help and that's why am at Linkedin.. ive a number of dot com ventures and i need financing. In Pak, we dont have ne VCs or incubators..<br>
<br>
Myers-Briggs typing system says am an INTP.. On Keirsey Temperament Sorter am NT and as per Enneagram am a 5 person with 4 wing (Fourish Five). <br>

              <p>hmmm..welll.. honestly, NONE :) am a dabbler with ideas. I pick up on multiple subjects/concepts/theories of interest. Study, develop understanding, contemplate, make my connections, see if it fits somewhere in my course, ideate, make conclusions and if it makes sense, archive/catalogue for future reference (if a venture idea/opportunity, then develop the concept,identify resources,pick up team, delegate and move on next idea...)</p>

    		    <div class="position">        <h3>Ideator</h3>      <p><strong>Vision International (visualbooks.com.pk)</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Non-Profit; 11-50 employees; E-Learning industry)</p>  <p>            May 2005         &#8211; Present        (1 year 9 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Vision International is an electronic publishing house specializing in multimedia Knowledgeware development. Established as a not-for-profit Social Enterprise (i.e. all profits are ploughed back into the company for capacity building and further development). We follow the Double Bottom Line approach of social enterprise model that allows us to ensure sound profitability and manifold Social Return On Investment (SROI).<br>
<br>
Starting in the area of primary education, we have developed a proprietary Multimedia Teaching Tool in Urdu/English languages for primary science classes 1-5 that is receiving great applause from the educational community. Our unique implementation model makes it easiest for the school to adopt the system. Our identity is of a Total Solution Provider. We've arranged with banks, leasing companies and hardware suppliers to help institutions in procuring equipment required for smooth operation. We take care of every thing from hardware to software to teacher's training.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Ideator, Founder</h3>      <p><strong>The Azad Network</strong>          (Self-employed)</p>              <p class="orgstats">(Self-Employed; Myself Only; Think Tanks industry)</p>  <p>            September 2004         &#8211; Present        (2 years 5 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">In Pak, we dont care about change. its all about adopting (or harshly rejecting) to whatever comes your way. Intended to become a Foundation, The Azad Network is my humble effort to create a conductive and proactive environment for creating and affecting rapid change (as opposed to merely reacting to it) This will require a paradigm shift in attitudes (centuries old dogmas n biases) which(in my opinion) can only be achieved through propagation of Evolutionary Spirituality, positive Transhumanism and mega scale Social Entrepreneurship.<br>
<br>
To accomplish this, focus will be primarily the educated youth in Pak and South Asia. The mission is to establish a 'Transformistic Organisation' that will serve as a 'Thought Center' n 'Internet Incubator' that will provide NEW AGE HEROES to the youth (Pak is a world without heroes),infuse them with the quest for progress n start a chain reaction of entrepreneurs with more n more inspired youth coming up with innovative ideas &amp; making success stories.</p>  </div>

The mission was to stimulate and promote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through Civic Awareness Communications initiatives using mass media (primarily internet). There were a series of innovative internet ventures that will be floating some time.. <br>
<br>
My role was of originator, visualizer, concept development, strategy direction, technical co-ordination, fund raiser etc. At FairCom I conceptualized and developed an 'Advertising on Demand Network'  and an 'Alternate Micro Payment Gateway' for online content publishers. <br>

explored a lot and established that it is only through tech n proper attitude adjustment that we're gonna be able to keep pace with the rapid change coming head-on. <br>
<br>
started VotersNet (VoteSmart.com.pk) an NGO that was dedicated to discussing political manifestos and policy issues. the only voter education organisation in Pak, the VotersNet advocated active participattion of educated paki lot into hardcore policy issues (average educated Pakis have merely bcome indifferent to watever is happening, almost every1 has accepted that nothing is gonna change)<br>
