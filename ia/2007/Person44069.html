I led the fight, and won, to discard military standard methods for these analyses as unsuitable for limited production units, with life outcomes based upon bernoulli trials; leading to the release of flight and test data for all solid propellant rocket motors ever flown by NASA for use in developing new, Bayesian analysis methods for rocket motor design and test.  I was awarded a letter of commendation from the International Satellite Organization for my work on Intelsat IV.  I was awarded a letter of commendation from Hughes for my project management methodology development; developed system architecture and mathematical models for STS space shuttle self-destruct system and STS SRB parallel ignition system.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Research Technician</h3>      <p><strong>SES, Inc.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 51-200 employees; Oil & Energy industry)</p>  <p>            1978         &#8211; 1978        (less than a year)        </p>      <p class="desc">SES, Inc.
