              <p class="summary">
                My professional experience to date has encompassed working both here in Ireland and Europe in the software industry. This in itself has been diverse as I have worked in both large and small scale companies as well as academic environments. <br>
<br>
My work by in large begun with development and has moved on to include test engineering, software quality assurance, customer relations, project planning as well as team management. By starting with development and working up I've garnered an appreciation for how things are done and how things should be done. <br>
<br>
My current goals are to seek out challenges which will allow me to expand on my technical background but also have a high level of interaction with customers both local and international.

    <p class="description">This work was an engineering role which concentrated on developing software solutions that tackled the problem of steel quality in Steel production facilities. This work looked at combining technologies like C++, Linux, TCP/IP networking and Mathlab to perform remote image analysis of the steel undergoing production. This image analysis looked at the crystal structure and was able to perform mathmatical calculations which could provide engineers with a real time update as to whether the steel was cooling too quickly for example.<br>
<br>
My role was to develop the software and capture the requirements through discussion with engineers and management in the production facility. Further, to develop test patterns to capture problems with the software.<br>
