            <h2>Mahesh Murthy&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Mahesh Murthy has 22 years of marketing and communications experience of which over 10 years are in online marketing. <br>
<br>
After dropping out of college, Mahesh sold vacuum cleaners from door to door, worked in advertising with Grey in India and Ogilvy in Hong Kong, where he won notoriety and awards as a creative director on HP, Microsoft, Unilever, The Economist, Pepsi and MTV - for whom he wrote and directed a spot voted &#x93;Asia&#x92;s best commercial of the decade&#x94;. <br>
<br>
He then moved to a Silicon Valley firm, CKS Partners (later, USWeb/CKS) as Creative Director, General Manager and Partner &#x96; where he helped create and launch the first commercial version of Yahoo in 1995 and the &#x93;Earth&#x92;s biggest bookstore&#x94; campaign for Amazon.com in 1997. After a successful NASDAQ IPO for CKS, Mahesh moved to head marketing at iCat, an e-commerce firm in Seattle subsequently acquired by Intel. <br>
<br>
Mahesh then returned to India to run Channel V, a rival to MTV, till its sale to Newscorp in 2000 and then founded Passionfund to invest in startups. Some of his investees include Geodesic (a 300-bagger), Compassbox &#x96; acquired by Careerlauncher, Cypherix, Indiaproperties and Webdunia. Mahesh penned a reasonably infamous column for India&#x92;s leading business magazines, Business Today and Businessworld, and is now playing the Donald Trump-equivalent role in Business Baazigar, a game show similar to The Apprentice, but involving entrepreneurs and business plans. <br>
<br>
While running search marketing campaigns for his favourite charity in 2003, Mahesh believed there was need to solve big issues around technology and business models - and set up Pinstorm with a bunch of great people to do so. With over 60 people and 4 offices, Pinstorm is among the world's leading search marketing firms today.<br>
<br>
Mahesh has a passion for early-stage investing and has teamed up with Pravin Gandhi and Bharati Jacob (ex-Infinity) to set up Seedfund, which aims to be the leading technology venture capital fund in India.

    <p class="description">After the successes of Passionfund (www.passionfund.com) and Infinity Ventures (www.infinityventure.com), the promoters of both have come together to create what they believe will be the leading venture firm for early-stage technology startups out of India.<br>

    <p class="description">Search engines make an enormous amount of money selling clicks to marketers. This is great business for the engines - but not particularly great for marketers who spend that money with little control and even less visibility over results.<br>
<br>
Pinstorm (http://www.pinstorm.com) was set up to redress the balance using a strong set of technologies developed and delivered by a smart set of people based out India. With offices now in Singapore, Malaysia, New Delhi and Bombay - and more on the anvil soon in China and Europe, Pinstorm has quickly grown to be among the world's leading firms in the space.<br>
<br>
Mahesh founded Pinstorm in 2004 and the company has had angel investments from senior people in Google, Ebay, Cisco and market players in India and Europe. The company has 60 people, is growing at 400% this year and is profitable.</p>

    <p class="description">Passionfund is among the very, very few year-2000 investment funds that has shown a positive return. With successes like a 300-bagger in Geodesic, a commuications software company; Compassbox - sold to CareerLauncher and other startups that have survived and thrived like Cypherix, Webdunia, EBS Worldwide, Indiaproperties and the like, the fund is living proof of staying true to its maxim of &quot;spend a little money and a lot of time on your startups&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mahesh has largely ceased new investments from Passionfund - is managing his current portfolio there and is looking at new investments through his new investment vehicle, Seedfund (www.seedfund.in).</p>

    <p class="description">Mahesh founded Geodesic with his partners Kiran Kulkarni, Pankaj Kumar and Prashant Mulekar as one of the first product-focused companies out of India - which was largely till then known for labour-arbitrage driven software services companies.<br>
<br>
Mahesh has helped drive the product and marketing strategy at Geodesic and has helped oversee the growth of the company from an idea to a business and stock market success, with a current market cap of over US$250m.<br>
<br>
Geodesic recently acquired Picopeta, developer of the Simputer. Mahesh sits on the board of the company and currently oversees product, marketing and M &amp; A initiatives.</p>

    <p class="description">Mahesh was recruited from the US to turn around an ailing music television channel in India - set up as a rival to MTV. <br>
<br>
Within a period of less than two years, Mahesh was able to cut losses from 90% to less than 10%, increase revenues significantly, re-position the brand from a music focus to a youth focus, oversee the production of a few dozen new shows and launch an online community for youth, vIndia.com as a sister concern that received a high valuation from merchant bankers.<br>
<br>
Mahesh stayed on till the channel was acquired for a tidy sum by Newscorp - Star TV - and he still enjoys a close rapport with the movers and shakers of the Indian media and entertainment industry.</p>

From a portfolio of a few hundred customers, Mahesh helped promote a skunkworks product iCat Commerce Online that allowed customers to build stores online with no knowledge of programming necessary - and helped the company gain over 5,000 users in a period of 6 months.<br>
<br>
The company was acquired by Intel in late 1998, at which time Mahesh left to pursue other options.</p>

He helped change the perception of the agency from a tech-only shop by leading the effort to win its first beer brand: Widmer, and followed up with well-awarded work on brands like Nike, Coca-cola, MCI, Microsoft and even Jim Henson's Muppets.<br>
<br>
Mahesh grew in responsibilites too, quickly, starting as a Creative Director, growing to General Manager of the Pacific Northwest region based in Portland, Oregon and then making it to Partner in the firm, which also went through a successful NASDAQ IPO.</p>

<br>
Mahesh headed a multinational, multi-cultural team that was tasked with the more difficult global projects - and with SWAT-team assignments on tough nuts to crack. The team consistently brought revenue and creative growth - winning pitches and awards across the region.<br>
<br>
During this period, Mahesh also consulted for MTV Networks to launch their channel across Asia and specifically, India. His promos for them won numerous awards including a &quot;Best Commercial of the decade&quot; for a spot he wrote, produced and directed.</p>
