          <h2>William Radcliffe&#8217;s Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary">
              I am an expert in the areas of digital imaging technologies, applications, and workflows  with experience spanning over 20 years.<br>
<br>
This began with work as a software engineer working on breaktrough medical imaging systems including CAT scanners, and MRI scanners. I worked on large scale document imaging systems as well as desktop image database systems before accepting a position at the Bill Gates startup now called Corbis. At Corbis have spent spent the last 12 years working on all aspects of digital imaging workflows and applications.<br>
<br>
At Corbis I worked on a project to invent a new invisible image watermarking and fingerprinting technology that was eventually patented by Corbis (patent #5809160). I worked on a variety of technologies used to protect Corbis images from misuse on the Internet as well as to explore superdistribution techniques. (patent #7113921).<br>
<br>
As these technologies have matured and evolved, I have turned my attention toward a new area of technology research, which I call &quot;deep persona based research&quot;. This involves doing deep dives into the applications of sophisticated technologies by taking on the persona of the potential customer. I am continuing this form of research now privately.<br>
<br>
In this capacity I search for, evaluate, and test the latest technologies used to process and control images as they flow through various business processes. This work includes the evaluation of products and services that employ visible and invisible watermarking and fingerprinting technologies, visual search engines used to looking for media that are the same or similar to other images, and software that can be used to streamline many aspects of a digital imaging workflow, with a special emphesis on optimization and efficiency.<br>
<br>
As an  offshoot of my persona research I became a professional photographer with work that is available for sale via the Science Faction Stock Photo agency. See: www.sciencefaction.net and www.gettyimages. com to see my work.

    <p class="description">As a Corbis Fellow (highest level of technology architect) within the Emerging Technologies Group, I was responsible for all aspects of imaging technology evaluation and trending within the company. I was a key contributor in defining the next generation imaging system architectures and business strategies for the company. I originally joined Corbis in the early 90's to help launch its professional image licensing business as one of the very first online media licensing businesses that existed.  Over the years my role evolved into more of a combination of technology and business strategist.  This involved spearheading the implementation of technology used to build out the Corbis infrastructure including the construction of its websites and the delivery of media to its clients. I also worked with all internal business owners within the company to evaluate next generation technology solutions of all kinds.</p>

      <p class="notes">I actually started out at Case Western Reserve as a premed student and thought I wanted to be a physician. I spent all my savings on the first years tuition and was faced with a cutthroat environment that was unlike anything I had every experienced before.<br>
<br>
Basically - lots of rich children of doctors driving around in expensive cars while I had to work nights as a janitor and take the bus. At the end of year 1, I had to take a step back and reevaluate things and decided to go to my Dad's engineering school.<br>
<br>
What put me over the edge was when I took the tour of the campus and the EE department had a lime green PDP-12 computer sitting in the back of the lab, playing the Scott Joplin song &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. I NEEDED to get my hands on that machine.<br>
<br>
As part of my transition from physician to engineer, I eventually took over that machine and learned the wonders of computer programming on a computer that could actually talk to the real world using AtoD and DtoA converters.</p>
