            <p class="summary">
              Program Manager/Executive for challenging technology development or systems engineering efforts with a twenty-two year track record of creating, building and leading dynamic teams that deliver breakthrough results to meet end objectives. I am a disciplined and creative hands-on leader who efficiently leads diverse aerospace, marine, automotive, energy, and advanced materials technology programs. This broad technology base has enabled me to bring different perspectives and innovation together to win new business, marshal resources and technologies, and build powerful teams that deliver results.
            </p>
            <h3>David Taggart&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
            <p class="skills">
              I build and lead development teams faced with systems-level challenges and no obvious answers.  Often, the challenge is breakthrough reduction in cost or weight, or system efficiency, and is often viewed as high-risk.  Programs I have lead include mobile systems such as aircraft, automobiles, or surface ships, and static systems such as photovoltaic power plants.<br>
Specific technical expertise is integrated design and application of advanced composite materials and structures.

Employing a vehicle architecture and design development processes that built upon my aerospace and materials background, I was responsible for all product and technology development.<br>
<br>
Upon assembling and leading an international engineering team based in F1 Alley in England, the Foundation Platform technology was developed to enable the production of automobiles meeting or exceeding today's size, comfort, quality, safety, and performance standards, but with zero emissions and superior economy. The key to achieving this level of performance was the application of an effective systems integration strategy in a Skunk Works style product development program, to integrate carbon composite structures, fully digital information management and vehicle control, and hybrid-electric propulsion.</p>
