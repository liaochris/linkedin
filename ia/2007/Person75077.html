              <p class="summary">
                Experienced telecommunications professional, with broad skills covering billing system design, IT, operations, call centre management, corporate finance, sales, marketing, contract management, product and service design, financial management, leadership and strategy.<br>
<br>
I have worked for multinationals and SME's, and have developed strong hands on skills with very detailed knowledge. I have worked at several companies on rapid growth curves aiming towards a planned exit or investment, and this condensed a lot of experience into short time scales. <br>
This includes leading the successful negotiation of a multi million pound Joint Venture with Vodafone in 2006, and subsequent sale of Flexphone to Vodafone in 2007, in addition to having a major role in the successful sale of Isis to Vodafone in 2006.

    <p class="description">Flexphone is a subsidiary of Vodafone.<br>
<br>
Established as a product solution of Isis Telecommunications Management Ltd in August 2003, Flexphone has had major success, press coverage and growth since its inception, winning several FTSE 250 clients and being first to market with mobile phones as a flexible benefit saving employees tax and national insurance of upto 41% and employers save 12.8% NI due to reduced salaries funding the cost of the mobiles.<br>
In January 2006 Isis moved the Flexphone business into a new subsidiary, Flexphone Ltd, which then signed an exclusive deal with Vodafone for the provision of mobile phones as a flexible benefit. Following a successful period of partnership Vodafone acquired Flexphone in May 2007, and the company continues to run as a separate subsidiary from its base in Ealing.</p>

    <p class="description">Head hunted to a wide ranging role covering IT, Billing and Customer Services. In my first year at Isis I lead the redesign of the in-house MoBill billing and customer care system that went on to win at the telecoms World Billing Awards in 2004 and 2005. <br>
Main objective of the role was to develop systems and operations to support the growth of the business towards a planned exit. <br>
I played a key part in negotiating the successful sale of the business to Vodafone in November 2006. As part of the sale I negotiated my exit from Isis to allow me to continue developing Flexphone Ltd, but I am tied in for 12 months as a consultant to both Vodafone and Isis.<br>
I acted as lead architect on Isis' key systems, and oversaw billing, revenue assurance, and decision support including key aspects of supplier relationship management with the mobile networks. Isis was one of the fastest growing companies in the UK (50th in the Sunday Times fast track in Dec 2004).</p>
