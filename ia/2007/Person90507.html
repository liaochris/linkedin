              <p class="summary">
                HI! WANNA GET MARRIED?<br>
<br>
After meeting an attractive stranger at a party, would you talk a lot about how great you are, ask a couple of cursory questions, then propose marriage? No? Many companies use a similar approach to revenue generation: bombard the customer with monologue, push hard for a close, and then move on to the next lead...opting for a short-term transaction rather than a long-term relationship. Sure, you might get hitched, but it'll take a lot of extra effort, and there's probably a very public divorce in the near future.<br>
<br>
In an era where trust is required for a sale, and customers' voices are now as loud as your own, I help companies build a BRAND DIALOGUE: creating an authentic offering, generating awareness, finding relevance, and guiding the customer perception and dialogue regarding your value. <br>
<br>
As both an agency exec and internal marketer, I've been living branding, positioning, social media and online marketing since 1992. I've provided high-level strategic counsel and ground-breaking marcom production to numerous clients, including Brita, BMW, Clorox, Ford, Kraft Foods, Lincoln, Mattel, the Mayo Clinic, Procter & Gamble, the Clinton Administration, and many others. Over the years, I've had fantastic opportunities: webcasting Ford CEO Jac Nasser, successfully pitching CEOs like Mattel's Jill Barad, Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang, and Taco Bell's Peter Waller, and having my work reviewed by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Jack Welch.  <br>
<br>
Traditional marketing techniques are dying, and pull marketing, high relevance and social media are the future of your revenue. Let me help you establish your brand and create a dialogue - and a relationship - that is sustainable, meaningful and built to last. You'll find me easy to work with, along with other clients who have lauded me on my dedication, extra effort and honest counsel.

    <p class="description">You've seen the work: when you've watched Mission: Impossible III, Braveheart, Lemony Snicket or 350 other films. When you've shopped at Nordstrom. When you've bought Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Camay soap, Acuvue lenses, or Sonicare toothbrushes. When you've eaten at Red Robin or Taco Bell. For thirty years, GIRVIN has been designing brands, identities and marketing programs for well-known companies and products around the world.<br>
<br>
I partnered with GIRVIN for 9 months this past year, providing brand strategy, naming, and messaging counsel for numerous clients, including Procter & Gamble, and UnionBay Sportswear. I've returned to my own firm for family reasons, yet I remain partnered with GIRVIN to bring their stellar creative talent to my Brand Dialogue clients.</p>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">For a brief seven-month period, I was responsible for marketing communications at WatchGuard, a Seattle-based internet security firm (hardware firewalls, security software, etc.). During this period, my team completely reskinned and "remessaged" the company, creating consistent branding and messaging across EVERY touchpoint: direct, trade ads, events, online, packaging, etc. <br>
<br>
The chairman of the board, upon seeing the efforts of our long hours and hard work, said it was the best marketing work he'd ever seen for the company.<br>
<br>
This was a difficult position for me. Much time was spent defending my team and fighting political battles. When that started to impact my health, I left to return to SoundPrinciples, my consultancy.</p>

    <p class="description">Created a JV between my own intellectual capital firm, Forge Partnerships, and Europe's largest CRM agency. Oversaw company's American operations in New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. My team sold $3.5MM in services within 8 weeks of launch, assisting in the US launch of BMW's MINI as well as work for USA Networks, Showtime and Swiss Re Insurance. <br>
<br>
We were smart. We were experienced. And then the Internet bubble burst. The resulting chaos that ensued was one of the toughest learning experiences of my life.</p>

<br>
Clients included Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Taco Bell, Brita and Clorox. I led top Ford execs through their first webcasts. Persuaded Ford management and dealers to completely change their approach to the Internet. Helped launch the Lincoln LS and new Mercury Sable.</p>

    <p class="description">If interactive agencies were people, Washington, DC-based Magnet Interactive would be a stunning, high-maintenance, coked-up supermodel. We hired beautiful, intelligent people from top business schools, partied like crazy, and pitched and won nearly every single engagement we went after. <br>
<br>
Besides managing production, I built relationships and managed large interactive marketing engagements for De Beers, Level 3, Mattel, the Mayo Clinic, MCI, and the US Department of Commerce. Our other clients included Crayola, Radisson, Haagen-Dazs, Kellogg's, Fedex, et al. <br>
<br>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">This Cincinnati company, once specializing in marcom and events and now an online marketer owned by WPP, typically keeps their stellar client list under the radar. During the early days of the commercial Internet, we were creating multimedia training and sales CD-ROMs, and our clients (RCA, GE, Lenscrafters, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods, et al) started asking for websites. <br>
<br>
In this role, I helped these firms take their first tentative steps into the online world. Every day we broke new ground...a very exciting time.</p>

<br>
Besides learning how to navigate the very challenging political waters of large corporations, these positions provided classical training in project management, data flow analyses, business process improvement and needs definition...training that would help me in the marketing career that began in 1994.</p>
