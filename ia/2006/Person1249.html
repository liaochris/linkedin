If you are interested in submitting a business plan, make sure your organization meets the following criteria:<br>
<br>
1. Your organization is located in the Mid-Atlantic Region (Maryland, Washington DC and/or Northern Virginia)<br>
2. You possess an experienced management team<br>
3. Your target market exceeds $200M<br>
4. Your product/service has a unique advantage (patent, proprietary technology, etc.)<br>
5. You are seeking the assistance of sophisticated, experienced angels.</p>  </div><div class="position">  <h3>Investor <span class="at">at</span> TerraCycle</h3>  <p>(Privately Held; 11-50 employees; Consumer Goods industry)</p>  <p>            November 2005         &#8211; Present        (1 year)        </p>      <p class="desc">&quot;At TerraCycle we manufacture affordable, potent, organic products that are not only made from waste, but are also packaged entirely in waste!

Ideal organizations are ones that want to make the world a better place and have high growth potential.<br>

I would like to help prevent the unnecessary deaths of any people anywhere in the world. I do not believe that anyone should die or be sent to their deaths because of their countries' or organizations' leaders' selfishness. Their selfishness grows when they have hurt egos or prides and they want revenge or when they believe that they do not need to share information with the rest of their people.<br>
<br>
Intelligence is too important to leave in the hands of our governments. We, the Internet community, have much more knowledge than any particular government intelligence agency has. (Wikipedia is a prime example.) Let's put it to good use and help prevent the unnecessary deaths of our people!<br>

&#xb7; Developed and prototyped the first Web Service and client proxy for the application. Also demonstrated that serialization of objects was possible through the Web Service.<br>
&#xb7; Researched and recommended Web Services (and SOAP), which was accepted as the method of communication between the Java application client front-end (View) through WebStart and the application back-end (Controller) that connects to the application EJBs (Model) in WebLogic.<br>

&#xb7; Orchestrated the migration of the dictionary/newswire web application in order for it to become J2EE compliant.<br>
&#xb7; Because of initial research conducted and demo setup using OC4J and our web application, the team was able to port the application relatively quickly to OC4J with minimal downtime when a problem arose with Apache. An unsuccessful port to OC4J would have been catastrophic to the delivery of the first iteration of the application and to the project itself.</p>  </div><div class="position">  <h3>Database Administrator/Personnel Adminitration Sergeant <span class="at">at</span> US Army - Army Field Support Center, Intelligence and Security Command</h3>  <p>(Government Agency; 10,001 or more employees; Military industry)</p>  <p>            November 1999         &#8211; October 2000        (1 year)        </p>      <p class="desc">&#xb7; Updated the organization's obsolete MS Access database to enhance information flow, reduce information redundancy, and improve general administrative efficiency.<br>
