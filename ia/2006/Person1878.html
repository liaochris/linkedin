I this position, I am responsible for all aspects of hierarchical management: communication between my team members and the rest of the company, performance reviews, goal setting, discipline, prioritization, scheduling, time management, staffing.</p>  </div>

In that role, I was responsible for overseeing many technical aspects in my coworkers' tasks. I organized scheduled &quot;bug scrums&quot; during which issues that can't be resolved by a single engineer are worked on in a group setting. I was the voice of the entire team toward all other groups of the company for most technical issues. I kept an eye on the bug database and on the various codelines that were receiving changes.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Software Engineer, Embedded Client</h3>      <p><strong>Openwave Systems Inc.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Public Company; 1001-5000 employees; OPWV; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            October 2001         &#8211; April 2005        (3 years 7 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">As a browser software engineer, I implememted support for MMS-SMIL in v6.1 as part of the messaging toolkit; I also added the ability for the browser to display multiple documents simultaneously and I made it possible for users to view the security certificates on the current page. I led an effort to improve performance in the layour engine after a customer reported issues in that area. I re-wrote the entire memory management subsystem for v6.2, dramatically improving performance and lifting several arbitrary limitations, and I then used the memory analysis tools I had developed to reduce the memory requirements for certain stress situations. In v6.2.3 I tightened the public interfaces of the browser, allowing to automatically detect re-entrancy issues. In parallel, I led the re-design and re-implemetation of many aspects of the browser with the stated goals of improving performance, enhancing compliance with web standards, and allowing the introduction of scripting in the browser.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Software Engineer, Graphics &amp; Kernel</h3>      <p><strong>Be Inc</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Public Company; 51-200 employees; BEOS; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            April 1998         &#8211; August 2001        (3 years 5 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">I started at Be as an intern, and during that period I took care of various kinds of graphics testing and certification projects. I also ported Sim City 3000 from Windows to BeOS. After officially becoming a full-time employee, I led the development of the primary demo that was used during the pre-IPO road show. I was then involved in several aspects of performance measurements, in some parts of a web browser UI, in USB driver development. I finally architected and played a major role in the implementation of Be's new non-recursive, efficient, scalable, highly configurable build system based on GNU make. I was laid off when most of Be's assets were purchased by Palm Inc, since my position as a build engineer had suddenly become redundant.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Commander, Training Company</h3>      <p><strong>French Air Force</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Government Agency; 10,001 or more employees; Military industry)</p>  <p>            November 1994         &#8211; August 1995        (10 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">As part of my education at the Ecole Polytechnique, with a NATO military rank of OF-1 (USAF equivalent Acting 2nd Lieutenant), I was responsible for 50 to 80 new recruits (at a NATO rank of OR-1 - USAF Airman Basic) each month at the beginning of their mandatory military service, overseeing their initial military training before they get dispatched to units or to further training. First-level management was done by personnel at NATO ranks OR-5 to OR-9 (USAF Staff Sergeant to Chief Master Sergeant) whose normal job was unrelated to training, and who would rotate every month.</p>  </div>

      <p class="desc">After the Ecole Polytechnique which gives a lot of theoretical and scientific knowledge, students are required to complete additional training in one of several approved areas, at one of several approved schools. Some schools create programs specially targetted at Polytechnique graduates, which gives them the prestige of actually having some of those graduates. ENSEEIHT offers such a program, explicitly trying to reduce the overlap between their courses and Polytechnique courses, and adapting their courses based on the needs and backgrounds of individual students. I picked ENSEEIHT over other options because of the explicit focus on practical training, which included a 15-month internship.</p>

      <p class="desc">The first year in Polytechnique counted as my year of mandatory military service; it was a year of leadership training (see details in my professional experience). After that, I realized that I didn't want to spend my life doing math and physics, and that the most computer-heavy curriculum wouldn't be enough for me. I decided to invest personal time into learning serious programming, even if that had an impact on my academic results (of course, I still worked enough to get passing grades in all classes). My extracurricular focus on computers allowed me to ace both school-wide programming tests. I chose the most math- and computer-heavy set of courses. In France, my education in Polytechnique is generally considered equivalent to a Master's degree in each of math, physics, and computer science.</p>

My stated goal was to join the Ecole Polytechnique, the most sought after engineering school, and I explicitly decided to maximize my long-term chances by planning and optimizing my education around the option to repeat the second year once, by focusing first on the core knowledge and then refining that knowledge the second time around.</p>
