          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Matt Mower&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I am a rounded technical professional equally at home in development, sales, or marketing activities.<br>
<br>
I have extensive development experience going back over ten years. In the last 2 years, despite not being in a full-time engineering position, I have become proficient with the Ruby programming language and contributed to the Rails framework as well as releasing one open source package and several libraries. Additionally I have a wealth of technical expertise in terms of protocols, formats, and systems admin.<br>
<br>
Over the last 2 years I have gained considerable experience of product management and strategic marketing. I have worked closely with business development and CEO/non-execs to develop product &amp; marketing plans. I have developed business propositions, run workshops, and presented to technical and non-technical audiences.<br>
<br>
I have developed products from initial idea, through working prototype, to full-scale implementation. With Evectors I co-authored the K-Collector enterprise knowledge aggregator which, in 2003, was the first tag based business aggregator. In my previous company I produced one of the first (if not the first) successful tagging module for a blog package.<br>
<br>
My career spans a diverse range of businesses including software houses, university, eCRM business, and knowledge management vendor.<br>
<br>
For a more in-depth view of who I am take a look at my weblog: &quot;Curiouser and Curiouser!&quot; (http://matt.blogs.it/)</p>

Working alongside the technical team we built and successfully took to beta the digital deposit box prototype and the exchange framework. I worked with the CEO to create and implement the marketing plan and with the director of business development on building partnerships with 3rd parties.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Technical Marketing</h3>      <p><strong>PAOGA Ltd.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            October 2004         &#8211; February 2006        (1 year 5 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">My key achievement was researching &amp; developing targeted business propositions addressing key market sectors identified by the exec team. I worked with the business development director and CEO pitching to prospects. I acted as the technical liaison between prospects/customers, business development, and the development team to ensure that customer requirements were properly discovered and clearly understood. Critically I was successful at communicating technical decisions, consequences, and plans to non-technical audiences.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Founder</h3>      <p><strong>Novissio Ltd.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; Myself Only; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            July 2002         &#8211; October 2004        (2 years 4 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">I started a company to persue the pioneering work I was doing in using blogs for lightweight knowledge management. I built a tool called liveTopics which was one of the first (if not the first) tool to allow bloggers to organize a collection of posts by tagging and turn their weblog into a semantic knowledge store.<br>
<br>
I learned many valuable lessons during this time in particular how hard it is to start a new venture, especially in an area that is ahead of the market. I also learned that focus is essential in any new venture and that it's very hard to be both a consultant and a software developer.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Partner</h3>      <p><strong>Evectors Software</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            September 2002         &#8211; August 2004        (2 years)        </p>      <p class="desc">I joined Evectors to co-author the first tag-based group RSS aggregator which we called &quot;K-Collector&quot;. A product ahead of is time in 2002, K-Collector is aimed at developing a light-weight approach to helping people make connections within their business and industry and be aware of important trends and discoveries. K-Collector was one of the first explicitly social applications for enterprises and exploits blogs, wiki, and RSS. <br>
<br>
In the process we developed Easy News Topics (and extension to the RSS2.0 format) for sending topics through RSS feeds created the first structured tag based internet portal &quot;W4&quot;. Paolo Valdemarin (Evectors CEO) and I conceived and designed K-Collector as an evolution of the work we had done on blogs and tagging previously.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Technical Consultant</h3>      <p><strong>Hipbone Inc.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 11-50 employees; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            July 2001         &#8211; July 2002        (1 year 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">As part of a 2-man European spearhead I supported the UK MD in sales activities including writing propositions, creating and delivering presentations to prospects, and developing integrations with customer systems. I was responsible for managing ongoing technical relationships with customers and partners and acted as 1st line support for the US mothership.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Development Manager</h3>      <p><strong>Metadyne Ltd.</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Computer Software industry)</p>  <p>            March 2000         &#8211; July 2001        (1 year 5 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">I lead a 5 man team developing a new framework for component based development in Java.
