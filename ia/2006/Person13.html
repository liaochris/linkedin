            <p>Always interested in networking, so feel free to contact me!<br>
<br>
I have over 12 years of marketing, management and operations experience in a variety of industries ranging from financial services and real estate to software and entertainment. As a marketing and strategic consultant, I've helped many small to large businesses grow by understanding and developing strong relationships with their customers, then creating relevant messaging and acquisition campaigns. <br>
<br>
My startup experience includes 2 financial services companies, including one VC funded, a film production company, a software company and several consulting and graphic design businesses.  <br>
<br>
Here are some highlights, feel free to contact me for more information on how I can help you!<br>
<br>
Portfolio, resume and bio: http://www.thebenspot.com <br>
<br>
Fun facts:<br>
* Most fun job - (other than my current one of course!) mechanic/souigneur for the Italian Mercatone Uno team during the US Pro Cycling Championships in 1994.  Millions of spectators, non-stop action and those boys were insane, especially the team manager!<br>
<br>
* Most boring job - telemarketing for a credit consolidation company.  At least the 2 minute walk from my apartment to the office was convenient...<br>
<br>
* Best life experience - competing at Olympic Trials in '96.  Racing by schools outside Charlotte with kids lined along the streets cheering and waving US flags was incredible.<br>
<br>
* Biggest accomplishment - Producing &quot;Deuces&quot;, an internationally-released feature film and world's first completely shot and edited in HD 24p.  So bleeding-edge, we were giving Sony advice on technical issues.<br>
<br>
* Coolest accomplishment - I was part of the space program when a college project I worked on flew on the Space Shuttle in '94 (STS-66)<br>
<br>
* Favorite childhood memory - my high school musicals.  Even though my parents thought I was &quot;wasting my time&quot;, having to balance nightly rehearsals for months with school taught me to be extremely efficient with my time</p>
