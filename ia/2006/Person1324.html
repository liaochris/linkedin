          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Frank Scaramuzza&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I started working with computers back in 1978 with a TRS-80 and immediately found myself drawn to the field.  Since then, I have worked as a computer operator, operational manager, database administrator, programmer, analyst, consultant, designer, and have finally arrived at Chief Information Officer.  The industries that I have worked with include Manufacturing, Distribution, Healthcare, Consulting, Educational and Homebuilding.  I have filled the roles of being an accountant, order taker, mail room clerk and supervisor, bank teller, vault teller, sales person and product manager.  When you own your own business, it is amazing what you get exposed to.  While my associates degree is in Computer Science, my bachelor degreee is in Management.  I have really found management to be interesting despite the challenges that you face as a manager day in and day out.  My ultimate role will probably involve getting more into theoretical and less practical application of technology, but I have to admit that I have often been complimented as being a very practical technologist.  It must be my very conservative nature at work.</p>

Homebuilding is not a strong technology sector, but by replacing many consultants with expert in house associates, we improved the internal departmental ranking from worst to best.  The turnover rate for the department remained well below industry and national averages.  During my tenure our team implemented a national Frame-Relay network and replaced that with a VOIP capable MPLS network.  We also deployed a Sales Automation tool across the entire enterprise and helped the company double in size in 5 years.  Other highlights include implementing a hand held construction scheduling solution across most of the company, moving to a dot-net architecture, and bringing in a revenue stream through a partnership with a major telecommunications company.  My duties included representing KHH at an industry consortium, and with many outside vendors, and negotiating deals as well as managing the company technology budget.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Director of Operational Systems</h3>      <p><strong>Starbelly.com</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 201-500 employees; Marketing and Advertising industry)</p>  <p>            June 1999         &#8211; November 2000        (1 year 6 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">What an experience!  This Dot-Com startup made a huge gamble in providing logo promotional products that would ship within 7 days of ordering.  There was a great and very creative group writing the web interfaces and my group tied those web feeds into the operational systems in something of a precursor to Web Services.  I watched the company grow at a fairly uncontrolled rate for over a year before being bought out by Ha-Lo Promotional Products for a $240MM cash and stock deal.  Things at Ha-Lo quickly went to pieces for a variety of reasons with the whole sad story ending in bankruptcy court with a lot of disappointed people.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Consultant</h3>      <p><strong>Kraft Foods</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Information Technology and Services industry)</p>  <p>            1993         &#8211; 1999        (6 years)        </p>      <p class="desc">Performed technical programming, worked on projects and implemented solutions for a variety of the business units at Kraft including Oscar Meyer, The Pizza Company and Phillip Morris.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Consultant</h3>      <p><strong>Compuletter</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Information Technology and Services industry)</p>  <p>            1997         &#8211; 1999        (2 years)        </p>      <p class="desc">Worked on Insurance Company solutions and other mass mailing management functions for this service provider.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Consultant</h3>      <p><strong>Chem Waste</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Information Technology and Services industry)</p>  <p>            1992         &#8211; 1999        (7 years)        </p>      <p class="desc">Worked on the implementation team of Lab Assistant, travelling to the East coast areas including Denville, Princeton and Newark New Jersey.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>President / CEO</h3>      <p><strong>Orion Consulting Services</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Information Technology and Services industry)</p>  <p>            September 1993         &#8211; September 1999        (6 years 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">Started and ran Orion Consulting Service Inc. in Mount Prospect, Illinois for many years, providing computer training, AS/400 consulting services and custom built PC machines.
