          <h2 class="hdr-sum">Helen Grant&#8217;s Summary</h2>

          
            <p>I was born on February 13th 1974 in Plymouth, England. I studied Creative Arts at Bath Spa University College, Newspaper and Magazine Journalism at Cornwall College and am part way through a postgraduate diploma in Journalism with the London School of Journalism. I have been a writer and journalist since 1998, writing features and working in-house for newspapers, magazines and television. My articles have appeared in Grazia, Real, Junior, Shout, Love it!, Prima, Canadian Newcomer and Mother &amp; Baby, amongst others. I am also an accomplished artist and designer.<br>
<br>
I am the founder and editor of H - a free fortnightly newsletter that is sent to over 1700 subscribers worldwide, including 800+ media professionals. The newsletter offers creative solutions for global success - freelance opportunities, motivation and inspiration for writers, journalists, editors, artists, photographers, designers, PR gurus and anyone in a creative role. The number of subscribers has grown at a phenonemal rate since it's launch in June 2006.<br>
<br>
I spent my childhood knee-deep in comics and books, enjoying authors such as Enid Blyton, Louisa May Alcott and Roald Dahl but preferring Cosmopolitan to Jackie and Danielle Steele to Roger Hargreaves. By the age of ten I had read the works of Steele and Enid Blyton and had progressed to writing my own short stories and poetry, winning first prize in a national inter-school writing contest with, 'The Cat That Went To School', a short story that was later included in a bedtime compilation for 2-year-old Prince William.<br>
<br>
My design business, Grantovich Publishing &amp; Design aims to be the brains behind a number of exciting launches over the next decade, the first being the Business Xchange Directory - an international bartering platform - launched in 2006. Grantovich offers a desktop publishing and copywriting service and has an art agency specialising in personalised art, with an exciting portfolio of artists and designers available for commission.</p>
