We scrapped the roles of Marketing Director and Category Director.   I took responsibility for a 25 person team responsible for:<br>
&#x95;	Strategy: leading the development of eBay UK strategy for 2007-09<br>
&#x95;	Customer planning across product, marketing, customer support .  <br>
&#x95;	Innovation prioritisation driven within 3 year strategic planning priorities<br>
&#x95;	Revenue, expense and resource allocation and targets<br>
&#x95;	Insight: a team of research and data analysts mining our customer data and qual data.  This includes segmentation and churn modeling.<br>
&#x95;	Culture change and people development: strong personal interest in change leadership and culture; have led eBay UK&#x92;s Great Place To Work initiative; many learnings about re-org and what works and what would do differently next time<br>
&#x95;	Motors business<br>

&#x95;	Leadership: built team from 8 to 30 with marketing budget grown from humble origins to in excess of &#xa3;10m with business objectives of acquisition and growing share of wallet of existing user base.  User base grown from 4 million to in excess of 10 million.<br>
&#x95;	Brand &amp; marketing strategy<br>
&#x95;	Internet marketing: built IM team from 4 to 8 providing highly cost effective CPA through search marketing, affiliate marketing and portal marketing.  <br>
&#x95;	E-mail &amp; Onsite marketing: lead development of behavioural segmentation on 10m+ user base; campaign management; partnership with dunnhumby<br>
&#x95;	Offline marketing: selected eBay UK&#x92;s first creative agency for launch of Oct 04 TV campaign; selecting media agency<br>
&#x95;	PR: challenge is to prioritise PR activity to focus on strategic marketing priorities; hired Head of PR from leading consumer PR agency with strong strategic planning skills</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>European Business Development Director</h3>      <p><strong>Bolt</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 51-200 employees; Online Media industry)</p>  <p>            February 2001         &#8211; February 2002        (1 year 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">Bolt is a venture-capital backed, US incorporated, web and mobile youth communications platform service.  Was responsible for selling Bolt&#x92;s white label community management solutions into the major European telecom operators, handset manufacturers, their portals and media companies.<br>
&#x95; Established high level contact in target clients within three months through tenacious networking <br>
&#x95;	Presented a compelling sales pitch whilst the product offering was often ill-defined and not certain to be built.   <br>
&#x95;	Chased meetings with many different groups in each target client with proposals reaching advanced stages with several including Nokia, BT Cellnet and Sky.  None ultimately closed.  Although tightening budgets in the telecoms and media markets was a contributory factor, the main reason was that we were selling a service to a buyer who wasn&#x92;t asking for what we had.  They only wanted a small part of it that didn&#x92;t require such major integration with their existing offerings.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Founder and Sales &amp; Marketing Director</h3>      <p><strong>Fonepark</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Telecommunications industry)</p>  <p>            January 2000         &#8211; February 2001        (1 year 2 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">A business providing location-enabled SMS text messaging chat services to consumers and businesses.<br>
&#x95;	Sought and successfully closed seed investment capital with The Accelerator Group (TAG) and an angel investor. Gained experience of detailed VC Term Sheets with minority shareholder protections as part of TAG&#x92;s investment negotiation.<br>
&#x95;	Hired a team of 9 young, relatively inexpensive, inexperienced staff that with hindsight would have been better composed of fewer, more experienced people.<br>
&#x95;	Successfully built the first and second versions of the application using an IT development company in Prague saving considerable money compared to equivalent UK resource. <br>
&#x95;	As it became apparent that it was at least another 12 months before mobile operators would be able to revenue share, we sought a buyer for the business.  <br>
&#x95;	Closed a cash and equity deal with Bolt, moved two of the Fonepark team across and laid off the remainder</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Interactive Marketing Manager</h3>      <p><strong>Unilever</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Public Company; 10,001 or more employees; Consumer Goods industry)</p>  <p>            December 1995         &#8211; December 1998        (3 years 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">Wrote a job description whilst working in Lever Europe in 1995 and sent it to Senior Managers in Unilever Corporate explaining that the internet had huge implications for Unilever and I would like a strategic development role.  <br>

&#x95;	Built a network of internet marketing agitators across the business culminating in the focusing of resource in North American and European Interactive Brand Centres.  Two $15m three-year deals were done with AOL and MSN making it at the time &#x93;the world&#x92;s largest commitment to internet advertising&#x94; (CNN, 1998).<br>
&#x95;	Ran many workshops with regular ratings on feedback forms as &#x91;inspirational&#x92;.  <br>
