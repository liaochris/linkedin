While I was at Eastern Airlines, income during tax season working for such companies as CLR/Fasttax where I was contracted to an American Express/IDS office to prepare client returns financed my travels the rest of the year.<br>
<br>
The other nine months of each year, I swapped off most of my hours and used the airline employee passes to take at least 50 adventurous trips. I visited Santiago, Chile, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Montreal, Canada, St. Thomas, San Juan, Jamaica, Bahamas, Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Italy, Switzerland, Greece,  Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and many American cities.</p>  </div><div class="position">  <h3>Tax preparer <span class="at">at</span> American Express/IDS</h3>  <p>(Public Company; 10,001 or more employees; Financial Services industry)</p>  <p>            January 1987         &#8211; April 1987        (4 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Hired shortly after CLR Fasttax obtained a contract to send tax preparers to American Express/IDS offices to meet with and prepare tax returns for American Express/IDS clients.

There was a huge markup in paper. It was not cost efficient for distributors like Ingram, Merisel or TechData to ship paper due to weight.<br>
<br>
Overnight I sold to a huge customer base including Computerland franchises, Jade Computer, The Printer Store, Software Etc franchises, Computer Showcase, Rainbow Computers, most computer stores in California and many stores across the country from referrals. My supplier gave me special pricing due to my volume thus increasing my profit. Contracted truckers to deliver on routes like Wilshire Blvd. and Olympic Blvd. in Los Angeles. <br>
<br>
Designed box with handle for 1,000 sheets and ordered a huge quantity. Stores were willing to pay almost as much for a 1,000 sheet box as they would for 3,000 sheets. It weighted less and took up less space. Closed business when computer paper became available in discount stores like PACE.</p>  </div><div class="position">  <h3>Sales Representative <span class="at">at</span> The Computer Store</h3>  <p>(Privately Held; 11-50 employees; Computer Hardware industry)</p>  <p>            1982         &#8211; 1983        (1 year)        </p>      <p class="desc">Sales representative at the very first computer store in the world.
