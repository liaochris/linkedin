    <h3>Karen Purves&#8217;s Summary:</h3>
    <p class="prosum">Started as an analyst where my problem solving skills were honed. In the 1980s,  organizations recognized that they needed to be more customer oriented when delivering services but the product approach was not working. So, for ten years, I worked with Blue Chip companies on addressing the gaps between delivery services and the marketing of them. This led me to setting up a college where marketing practitioners could gain professional qualifications while improve their performance in the workplace and career prospects.<br>
<br>
In 2000, I made a major change by moving to the not for profit sector. Initially, there was a period of learning the different ethos and important values of the sector before working as an interim manager and consultant. <br>
<br>
To offer the best service to clients and customers who may not have a choice means that the organizations need to look after their staff. Their staff can then look after their customers and clients accordingly.<br>
<br>
All too often, this isn't happening!</p>

This means that from the senior manager down to the shop floor, there is pressure to continually improve. That is fine when there is a wide variation between current practices and best practice. But, what happens when you are already working to best practice and you need to improve, improve, improve....<br>
<br>
At Answers Forte, we match you with a coach that will enable you to get the most from your sessions. We have five coaches all working in a business environment. To make sure you get a coach with the best fit, interview three coaches. Feel which one you can work with, which one will coach you to reach your potential.<br>
<br>
Good coaches can coach you beyond their own experience level. Coaching is not about giving you answers. It is about you finding those answers and taking action.</p><p class="bottom">  	<strong>Facilitator</strong><br>Answers Forte			(Privately Held; 1-10 employees)<br>  <span name="industry">Management Consulting</span> Industry<br>    May 2006     &#8211; Present     (3 months)<br>  </p>  <p class="possum" name="summary">Gone are the days where we are in a stable environment and change happened slowly. Now, everything is fast, change is around us all the time. Pressure to make change, move, or as Tom Peters said sometime ago, 'dance on a moving carpet'.<br>
<br>
At Answers Forte, we work with groups of people to be able to find answers to their problems or issues so they can actively participate and positively contribute in their work environment.<br>
<br>
For this we use a number of different approaches:<br>
<br>
- introduce coaching skills to all managers<br>
- develop and facilitate learning sets as a way of developing leadership and problem solving in groups of people. This may be peers or with a cross section of the people in the organization.<br>
- learn about how we communicate. What gets in the way? How can we remove the barriers?</p><p class="bottom">  	<strong>Director</strong><br>Leaping Frogs Forte Ltd			(Privately Held; 1-10 employees)<br>  <span name="industry">Non-Profit Organization Management</span> Industry<br>    February 2005     &#8211; Present     (1 year 6 months)<br>  </p>  <p class="possum" name="summary">We offer interim management, consultancy, coaching and facilitation to the private, public and not for profit sectors where there is an issue on service delivery. <br>
<br>
We have a network of people who work on different projects matching the needs of organisations.<br>
<br>
Area of particular interest include:<br>
- customer service <br>
- performance management systems<br>
- managing change through improving skills and culture of the organisation</p>
