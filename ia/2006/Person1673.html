        <h2><img src="/img/icon/icon_summary_24x24.gif" width="24" height="24" alt=""> Holly Stevens&#8217;s Summary</h2>

        
          <p>My work dances among writing, editing and graphics elements; I was never content to focus on one more than the others. I was most motivated when doing work for causes I believed in, whether for free or for hire. My dream as a young mother was to attend seminary for the love of the learning; to use my M.Div as credentials to further my fledgling career as a religion writer; but to live for the weekends, opening my home to retreatants seeking solitude, or silence, or space, or safety to share one's stories. It was a dream incompatible with a marriage that was noisy, active, and enmeshed in the material world, and after much soul searching, I abandoned it and returned to school to become a special ed teacher. But when my world was shattered by the end of my marriage in 2000, I grew into relationship with a friend I'd known for 19 years, who had followed a similar dream. Bill and his first wife had acquired 40 acres of woods and meadows in the hills of North Carolina, creating a home/retreat center with 24 beds while he was a Friends pastor. She died, far too young, in 1979; Bill moved on alone, hosting spiritual and environmental retreats until we reconnected in 2001, marrying in 2004. My advanced cancer has ended the retreat ministry here at Glenagape, although Greensboro Montessori School now uses our &quot;raw land&quot; for a middle school land immersion program. So here I am, writing and editing and publishing inside the house via my keyboard and DSL connection, and watching students get to know the land and the stories and mystery it holds in store for those who observe it from close up with bare hands. My life is a circle; I am content. But in my next life, if there is one, I hope to come back as a troubadour -- singing and traveling and listening to others' stories and telling my own and making just enough dough to ward off fear and cold.</p>

I learned a lot, was treated well enough, and left on good terms, but I never understood the corporate culture. Looking back, I'm sure I stayed too long! In 2002, I contacted Wachovia (which is really First Union now, but that's another story...) to get proof of my past employment and was told that the bank doesn't keep employee data more than 10 years. It seems strange to have given so much of my spirit to a place for six years and for not a trace of me to remain there. (That's not a moan -- just a wonder at the transience of life.)</p>  </div>
