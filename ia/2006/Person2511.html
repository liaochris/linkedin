    <h3>Lonny Paul&#8217;s Summary:</h3>
    <p class="prosum">The ability to create 'controlled chaos' may seem like a monumental task, and yep, it sure is, but you have to bite down and just make it work.  And it will.  Everything has a point at which it is most easily moved into the position which you desire.  Put your shoulder into it and realize it isn't that hard, if you just think about it for half a second.<br>
<br>
So, I've done just about everything in the world of marketing, so much in every niche of the industry, and I have enjoyed each one so much!  I have also learned to develop proper strategy to be prepared for obstacles - while maintaining a clear vision of the upcoming trends and changes necessary to maintain a superior position within the marketplace.</p> 
  

  
    <h3>Lonny Paul&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
    <p class="prosum">eCommerce marketing guru, over 20 yrs experience in multi-channel marketing-visionary on internet trends, new channels of development <br>
<br>
Biggest problem - IDIOTS.  People flailing blindly in the dark not realizing they hadn't opened their eyes.  <br>
<br>
If half of the advertising industry could stop bitching about what ISN'T working and find out WHY, maybe something would get done.  <br>
<br>
At the center of every problem is a simple, logical solution.<br>
