Our selection process focuses on a person's vision, drive to realistically earn a mid-6 to 7 figure income in the next 18 months, and a commitment to coach others in our Millionaire Mindset Conference program.

If you run across anyone who would be open to receiving hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for their ministry or faith-based non-profit without asking anyone for any money whatsoever?  If we could take most of the fundraising responsibilities off their shoulders and help them accomplish their monetary goals in approximately 6-12 months, would you know anyone who might be willing to spend a few minutes to meet with our director?<br>
