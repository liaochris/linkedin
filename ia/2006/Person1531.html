    		    <div class="position">        <h3>CEO</h3>      <p><strong>Sonific</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Online Media industry)</p>  <p>            June 2005         &#8211; Present        (1 year 8 months)        </p>      <p class="desc">Sonific was founded in July 2005, with the mission of making large catalogs of great music available for the many types of audio-visual usages on the Internet, both for private / non-commercial or promotional purposes, as well as for professional (B2B) users, and licensed products and services. Sonific's SongSpots&#x99; service is our first B2C release, reflecting our philosophy that offering better tools for music discovery and providing new, free platforms of exposure is what will really sell music, going forward, and that the viral nature of the Internet is perfectly suited to help get the word out for new and established artists and their music. We also believe that many of today's 'digital natives' and 'peer-producers' want to personalize their web presences, customize the look and feel of their sites, integrate multimedia where they can, and will ultimately use the web as a fully interactive, 2-way, personalized, and therefore 'sonified' medium.</p>  </div><div class="position">        <h3>Co-Author</h3>      <p><strong>&quot;The Future of Music&quot;</strong></p>      <p class="orgstats">(Privately Held; 1-10 employees; Online Media industry)</p>  <p>            January 2005         &#8211; Present        (2 years 1 month)        </p>      <p class="desc">Some early praise for The Future of Music:<br>
<br>
&#x93;Amid all the shouting and confusion, along comes The Future of Music, which in a calm and clear voice explains the essential issues roiling the music business today.  Most importantly, this is written directly for musicians and their fans, rather than business people in the music industry.  If you want to know what you're getting into as you develop your music career, and where music will be coming from in the future, you have to read this book.&#x94;<br>
Gary Burton, Grammy-winning vibraphonist<br>
<br>
I know of no other text that as beautifully and concisely presents the fundamental challenge that music now faces. This book is essential for anyone who wants to understand what is at stake in this debate.&quot;<br>

I try to connect the dots, strip it down to the core, look at it in 'black &amp; white' and / or 'color' -modes, and put the puzzle together so it looks like a strong image to me.</p>  </div>
