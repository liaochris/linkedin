    Sr. Financial Analyst - Los Angeles County California.  <br>
<br>
As a finance expert, in addition to the typical annual budgets, monthly financial forecasts, KPI Financial Reporting, and advanced ad hoc financial analysis, etc., I focused mostly on Microsoft Excel and my Miscrosoft Access programming and development to automate/integrate the various financial systems in Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). All fully integrated and automated with VBA. Worked one-on-on with a great team of finance, accounting, and excel, access, and SQL server experts.

    Financial Systems Analyst, Finance Department.<br>
<br>
Tenet Healthcare hired me as a Financial Systems Analyst (Microsoft Excel, Access, VBA, for Accounting, Finance), to work in their finance department.  There I leveraged my advanced Excel and Access skills to integrate and automate the work under my control. One example, I was able to fully automate the daily report so that it would run and distribute two hours before I arrived at work. That saved me two hours work per day and enabled me to compete the reports four hours early.  The power of automating and integrating Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Access.<br>
<br>
In addition to the typical financial budgets produced in Microsoft Excel and Access, the accounting forecasts, reporting, analysis, etc., I focused on advanced Microsoft Excel programming and Access programming to automate/integrate financial systems in Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Work performed onsite in Orange County California. I worked closely with the CFO and the CEO on various budgets and reports.<br>
<br>
In addition to the typical Microsoft Excel financial budgets, forecasts, reporting, ad-hoc analysis, etc., I focused on Microsoft Excel programming and Access Database programming to automate/integrate the various financial systems, including the AS400, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). My primary job was to automate and to integrate Microsoft Excel, Access, and the AS400, to do what took days into minutes, and hours into seconds, while eliminating costly human error. This project was locally based in their corporate office in Costa Mesa California.

    &#x2666;&#x2666;&#x2666; Testimonial from LinkedIn.Com &#x2666;&#x2666;&#x2666;: <br>
<br>
&quot;Excel and Access, it's proprietors, it's quality and level of work are all phenomenal. We enjoyed our engagement with them on a special project. They were flexible, nimble and was able to meet our very high standards, requirements and tight deadlines. They were available and met the deadlines comfortably. We would hire them again if need arises. They care about their clients and made sure we were satisfied with the completed work. <br>
<br>
I would recommend their work to anyone, especially if you are looking for an elegant solution with limited resources. They will deliver a sophisticated solution, on time, to automate any need via excel or access. <br>
<br>
Best, <br>

    Three of the E&amp;A Team members work with the team at Verizon Wireless, two being Microsoft Excel MVPs.<br>
<br>
We assist Verizon with their Microsoft Excel 2013 workbooks, both as local Microsoft Excel Trainers, and remotely as Excel and Access programmers. The Director of Training at E&amp;A went onsite for Microsoft Excel training.  Developers on this project worked out of our Northern California, Oregon, and our Texas developer offices.  Verizon is in New Jersey, as many of our clients come from this and the surronding New York areas.<br>

    Honda in Southern California hired me to provide local Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server Database Development for Honda's North American Finance division, in Los Angeles California. Long-term onsite project that involved data analysis, data scrubbing, and data migration on an unbelievably large amount of data, taking 9 months to complete.  This was part of their system upgrade to their new Business intelligence system. One of the largest projects taken by Honda in years, involving well over 100 people. I worked directly with the project manager. I was responsible for building the SQL Server database to improve efficiency.

    Developed a cutting edge Microsoft Access 2010 Database for the Toyota corporation.<br>
<br>
A while back we completed a really simple and easy to use Microsoft Access 2010 database for the Toyota corporation. The database was done partially locally onsite at the client, with the rest of the work being completed remotely, at one of our Excel and Access Developer offices on the East Coast. The database used a simple to navigate graphical user interface based on Access forms, to truly allow a point and click experience for the user. I have included a few print screens which are displayed below, to allow you to see how an advanced GUI is built, which is why Toyota hired us.

    I Developed a fully automated and fully integrated Microsoft Access Database application for Toshiba's Accounting and Finance departments, locally, in their Toshiba North American Finance corporate office in Irvine California. Both departments share the application, each for their own use.  Used by up to ten people, throughout the departments.  Built in Office 2007.<br>
<br>
Testimonial: &quot;Details of the Recommendation: &quot;My company (Toshiba in Irvine, CA) hired Mr. Fennell in 2009 to improve our financial planning model by setting up Access databases to process the huge amount of data we deal with on daily and montly basis. Mr. Fennell not only understood our business needs well and reflected them in Access, but his work was done so accurately that 4 years later, we're still using his work. He also did a great job training all our individuals to maintain the databases and make changes as our business needs evolved over the years. I highly recommend Mr. Fennel and his company to anyone who is looking for an expert, knowledgeable consultant.&quot; <br>

    I was hired by Alliance Imaging in Anaheim California, near Angel's Stadium, to develop M&amp;A Analysis and development in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access for the CFO and Vice Presidents.  I built new financial models, primarily in Excel to replaces the financial models they had been using.  The end result was to shave hours of time off of each M&amp;A valuation, and to standardize the reports and output. I presented my findings to their team of M&amp;A experts, including the CFO, COO, and various VPs.  I also worked with the firms that were considering the mergers.  Great client, great project.

<p class=" ''">
    Jeff has developed a Microsoft Excel 2013 application to assist day traders with their daily analysis of their trading. Stocks, Options, and Future traders.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can take your platform or brokers trade report at the end of day and copy/paste your trade data directly into the trade analyzer and determine what you are doing wrong, where you are doing it and to what degree it is affecting your trading.<br>
<br>
With the trade analyzer, you can custom design the Excel trading spreadsheet to fit your style of trading. Define your own trade setups, management style, timeframe and time of day. Even create your typical errors you commonly make and watch the analyzer track how often you make those errors, and how it is affecting your trading. Then, simply copy your trade log from your platform or brokers report and paste directly into the Excel trading spreadsheet, no more manual inputting of trade data, so with a few clicks of hot buttons, the analyzer breaks down your trading style and creates a Batting Average, Win/Loss ratio and P&amp;L for each scenario of your days trades. Automatically creates a Bar chart of your demons, and keeps track of your trade statistics on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual totals as you progress through the year.&quot;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    The United States Social Security Department hired us to provide advanced Microsoft Excel VBA Training. The work was performed remotely out of Texas, by David, a top notch Microsoft Excel and Access expert.  David did such a wonderful job that the client wrote the nice testimonial below.<br>
<br>
Testimonial: &quot;I want to thank Christopher and David for providing me with such a great training experience. I was quite impressed with your quick response to accommodate the Advanced Excel VBA Programming (Part I) training in such a short notice. It was a pleasure to work with my instructor David; he explained concepts and solutions to problems in detail and made sure I understood them before moving on to new topics. The training conducted via computer screen sharing made my training experience quite comfortable. David opened my eyes to a much leaner and faster way of coding. I was very impressed by his vast VBA knowledge. He provided excellent alternatives to tackle the many issues presented. His &#x201c;computer side&#x201d; manners made me comfortable to ask my many questions during different topics.  I look forward to using your services in the future in order to advance my VBA knowledge, and I sure hope to get David as an instructor again. I will refer your training services to co-workers and other components for all their VBA needs.  SSA - Social Security Administration&quot;

    Details of the Recommendation: &quot;I've had the pleasure working with Christopher's company, specifically with Guy Fawkes, within the past year. We were having a problem finding an online timeclock program that could meet some of our specific needs and be accessible across the VPN connecting our three medical offices.<br>
<br>
The were able to come develop an Access solution that met 100% of our needs for the same or less up front cost of existing programs and without built-in maintenance fees. Now that we know what can be done, we've got more needs and are developing the program further. We're satisfied enough that we'd like to market it to practices with similar needs.&quot; <br>

    I found Christopher through a web search, desperate to find help on a Access/Excel project. Christopher put me in contact with one of his developers. My final result is exactly what I expected. Christopher is a business person that cares about his reputation, and conducts his business the same way. I would recommend his services anytime.

Hello, my name is Charles Enzen and I created a transportation budget for the Film Industry. I contacted five various vendors to copy protect the installation of such program on one computer only. Guest what Kevin came up with a simple, easy to us, when the client open the program it just click &#x201c;enable macros&#x201d; and the program open immediately. I recommend Kevin at ExcelAndAccess.Com to anyone that need his fast services, a very reasonable cost in regard of Microsoft Access, Excel VBA and more. He keep in contact every steps of the way, suggest solutions, modify as per my need&#x2019;s. To a top notch programmer

    Novatech Electronics originally hired us in 2010 to do a small Office project.  They came back in 2013 for additional work, a second phase to the project if you will.  His informal feedback is below.  It shows how much of an impact proper automation and integration of the Microsoft Office applications can have on a business.<br>
<br>
He said: When I first came to you, I had about 300 products on my ebay site which I was drop shipping from one supplier. It took me about 2 weeks to manually go through and update the inventory just for that, which needless to say caused us to sell a lot of products that were out of stock. Your software allowed me to not only manage the 300 products we had in about 10 minutes, it allowed me to not sell out of stock items anymore, and manage multiple suppliers utilizing every product they stock. Now I have over 80,000 products in my database with over 25,000 active listings on my website, ebay and amazon. Now it takes us about an hour and a half a day to manage all the products we have with your original software, this new software will automate the entire process and then some, and I am really excited to get it in production.

    We were hired by one of the principals at Watts Gwilliam &amp; Co. to build a stock trading investment application in Microsoft Excel.  The client initially spoke with several of our competitors, but none were able to do the work.  Jacob however works with all sorts of investors, be they options and futures, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.  Jacob is very good at this type of work.  Jacob did the Microsoft Excel programming for the client, once again exceeding the clients expectations.  Please see testimonial below.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I would highly recommend Christopher and his team to anyone. I hired them to do some excel programing that two previous programmers turned down because they didn't understand the capital markets or have anyone on their team with any stock or option background. I was very pleased with the results and what was most impressive is how quickly they completed the project and would respond to my questions.&quot;<br>

<br>
Dear Christopher &#x2666;,<br>
I've written this recommendation of your work to share with other LinkedIn users.<br>
<br>
Details of the Recommendation: &quot;We've worked with Christopher and his team at Excel &amp; Access, LLC since 2010. Christopher has a crack team of programers who've helped us build a number of very sophisticated macros and apps using Excel and have really helped us expand the reporting capabilities of our CRM. Very good results, fast turn around, and great attention. I'd recommend them to anyone who's stretched their own Excel capabilities to the limit and need the next 5 steps higher, and for anyone looking to build d-bases and reporting within Excel and Access! Very strong team and Christopher has always been great to work with personally.&quot; <br>
Service Category: IT Consultant<br>
Year first hired: 2010 (hired more than once)<br>
