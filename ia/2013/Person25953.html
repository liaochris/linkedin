    Article comparing mainstream merchandising strategies for natural organic products. Current strategies fail to address how consumers shop.<br>
<br>
While there are some who would lead you to believe that all consumers will search out natural/organic product offerings at any cost, this is not the case.<br>
<br>
Think about how your customers shop your store.  Do your customers only see items that are at least 70% natural/organic when standing in front of the bread section?  Of course not!  Your customers see the complete assortment of breads you sell.  <br>
<br>
Are your customers only interested in natural items or do they shop at your store to buy both conventional and natural items in the same trip?  If the latter is true then having items in a separate natural/organic section will cause customers to overlook other items you sell.  Conversely, customers shopping the conventional section will completely ignore your natural product offerings.  Integrating natural and conventional gives your customers the opportunity to compare items side-by-side and then choose what&#x2019;s best for their needs while also giving you an opportunity to up-sell and convert them to natural/organic products.  Segmenting the integrated section will make it more shopper friendly.  This is the best of both options; a section that is both integrated AND segregated/segmented.        ...........<br>
<br>
Natural and organic retailers and manufacturers deserve to benefit from the same practices and technologies as their conventional counterparts &#x2013; without sacrificing what makes the natural/organic channel distinctive. This is an area lacking in natural.

Don't let consumer packaged goods companies dominate mainstream discussion of the natural products industry. Use this road map to take charge and accelerate your sales.<br>
<br>
The natural products industry has enjoyed significant growth due to education and the global spotlight. The signs are everywhere. You can't turn on the TV, listen to the radio or read a blog or newspaper without somebody touting the benefits of organic. Combined with staunch advocacy and awareness for purer/healthier &quot;better-for-you&quot; product alternatives, organic is now the center of national conversations.<br>
<br>
What's next is for the natural products industry to take a leadership role in its own growth and development. You've probably heard the phrase, &quot;Lead, follow or get out of the way.&quot; Our industry can no longer afford to be pulled into the mainstream.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Traditional consumer package goods (CPG) companies should not have the largest voice in marketing and merchandising natural and organic products. We know the products and our consumers far better, and we should be leading that discussion.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Are you making the Dr. Oz excuse or capitalizing on the Dr. Oz effect in your store? If you choose the latter, here's how profitable your store could become.<br>
<br>
When shopping in natural stores, I frequently hear retailers give lots of excuses to justify why their products are out of stock. My least favorite is, &quot;We sold out of the item because Dr. Oz mentioned it on his show.&#x201d; <br>
Retailers rarely, if ever, tell me when an out-of-stock item will be available. Instead, they choose to blame Dr. Oz when they could be capitalizing on the opportunity to convert me into a happy and loyal customer who could refer others to their store. <br>
Nothing is more frustrating for consumers than finding out of stock items, especially on advertised sales. Bottom-ranked, unpopular items that frequently take the place of absent top-selling items force consumers to shop other retailers.<br>
Every shopping trip must absolutely leave a favorable impression given the number of retail choices consumers have today. Just like other consumers, if I can&#x2019;t easily find what I need, I will go to another store. As the expression goes, &quot;You never get a second chance to make a good first impression.&quot;

<p class=" ''">
    Predicting consumer demand and planning effective promotions of a natural product can be extremely challenging, especially for new natural or organic brands. However, this does not need to keep you up at night.<br>
<br>
The biggest challenges are inconsistent distribution (items with spotty distribution throughout the chain), inconsistent and confusing merchandising (items not merchandised the ways consumers shop) and inconsistent promotion/pricing. These challenges are dramatically amplified by unsolicited celebrity endorsements. <br>
<br>
Solving these problems will help regulate your brand's supply and improve customer satisfaction. For natural retailers, this means you have consistent messaging to consumers as the go-to destination for &quot;As seen on TV.&quot;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Brokers offer a variety of services to help you grow your natural company, but are you giving up too much control? Here's how to make the most of the partnership.<br>
<br>
Most manufacturers have a love/hate relationship with their brokers. That's because most brokers support several different brands and only have a limited amount of time to give yours the attention it needs.<br>
<br>
Brokers and distributors provide a valuable service, allowing small organic and natural companies to grow quickly and compete across different channels and retailers. But few manufacturers have any real insight into their broker's day-to-day activities.<br>
Some manufacturers effectively give the broker the &#x201c;keys&#x201d; to their company and expect them to manage all aspects of their success.&#xa0;This is a huge mistake! The relationship should be a true partnership.<br>
<br>
If you want to get the most out of the relationship, you need to take a more proactive role in directing your broker&#x2019;s efforts. This will dramatically improve your sales while helping you better understand your customers.&#xa0;<br>

    Want to maximize the return on investment in your store? Who doesn't! Try these category management tips.<br>
<br>
ROI (return on investment) is perhaps the easiest business concept to understand and yet the most difficult to measure. While break even is certainly better than losing money, it's difficult to fully understand what activities generate sales.&#xa0;<br>
For retailers, your goal should be to maximize the ROI for every action you take.&#xa0;<br>
&#xa0;<br>
It's easy to calculate the additional sales needed to justify a new sales person, a new sales strategy, a promotion or a new item in a category. But measuring category management success can be complicated by understanding what category management is and its place in your business.<br>
&#xa0;<br>
Paying a category manager to pull reports, keep shelves full and build presentations will not provide a high return. Category management provides the highest return when used to drive sales, instead of reacting to day-to-day business needs.&#xa0;<br>
&#xa0;<br>
Category management helps new sales representatives sell more, increases sales of new items and promotional effectiveness, and it takes the guesswork out of evaluating new sales strategy results.&#xa0;<br>
&#xa0;<br>
Try these three strategies to increase your ROI using category management.<br>

    Is Kroger threatening your natural store? 5 strategies to take<br>
<br>
By Daniel Lohman, CPSA in New Hope 360 Blog&#xa0;<br>
July 16, 2012<br>
<br>
As Kroger pledges to lead in natural products retail, it's time for natural retailers to unite in order to stay relevant&#x2014;and in business.<br>
<br>
Kroger recently announced its commitment to becoming the leading retailer of natural products. More than ever before, it's time that natural retailers unite to take a proactive leadership role in the natural industry.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
The news goes well beyond&#xa0;disagreements on the definition of &quot;natural&quot; or the importance of non-GMO.&#xa0;This cuts to the very heart of our industry and challenges our future.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Kroger's announcement means greater opportunities for top-selling brands to be represented at their stores. While I applaud their commitment to natural brands, their success could potentially stifle local and national natural retailers' growth. This will also have a dramatic impact on small local and regional natural brands.<br>
<br>
Mainstream retailers like Kroger cherry pick the top-selling natural brands in addition to providing a wide variety of natural private label items. Their reach and their ability to connect with consumers is far greater than even Whole Foods Market.<br>
<br>
This is an unparalleled threat to the natural products industry. Kroger has some of the strongest consumer loyalty rates in the entire food industry. Their true strength is converting consumers to loyal shoppers.&#xa0;The Organic Trade Association states that 54 percent of organic food sales were in mainstream retailers (in 2010). That number will only continue to grow.<br>
<br>
It's time that natural retailers maximize each and every selling opportunity. This means turning occasional shoppers into committed loyal shoppers.<br>

All products are not created equal. Is private label the best strategy for your natural store?<br>
<br>
Would you rather have a high-penny profit on select items or build a long-term business strategy that brings loyal customers to your store? The answer may affect how you approach private label products.<br>
Private label has a place on retailer shelves but should not be the primary strategy for any retailer who wants to grow sustainable sales. Customers shop brands first and usually turn to private label as a cost savings. Most consumers will gladly pay a premium for quality.<br>

There are a lot of opinions and advice around strategies to protect natural retailers against mainstream retailers like Kroger or Walmart. I'd like to share a story about a local&#xa0;retailer who took on a large box store and is still thriving today. The parallels between natural and conventional retailers are identical.&#xa0;<br>

A recent study by Nielsen claims that less than half of all trade promotions fail to increase brand or category growth. This is unfortunate, because the main goal of trade marketing is to do just that: grow one's brand by increasing the demand at the retailer/distributor level.<br>

    New via New Hope 360: Increase your market basket size over your competitors' with these 10 retail strategies for serving natural shoppers.<br>
<br>
The term &quot;market basket &quot;(or shopping basket) is perhaps one of the most important terms in retail.<br>
<br>
Manufacturers and retailers strive to understand consumer buying habits including the average list of items found in customer&#x2019;s shopping baskets during each visit. This allows retailers to customize product assortment, marketing strategies, in-store merchandising, promotions and pricing to better meet consumer needs.<br>
<br>
This is far less intrusive then the tracking cookies websites use to monitor your activities; the personal information you freely provide to Facebook; or the smart phone application that automatically provides coupons when you enter your favorite retailer.<br>
While we are all concerned about privacy concerns, we desire convenience and appreciate the local retailer that welcomes us by name when we enter the store.<br>

<br>
Some mainstream retailers believe that consumers will search out natural and organic products at any cost. But is that the case?<br>
<br>
Does a successful merchandising strategy involve integrating or segregating your natural product mix? It's a hot debate, but I think there's a clear winner.<br>
<br>
First, the basics. Categories are divided into segments and segments are defined by the way the consumer shops the category. For example, powder or liquid laundry detergent. These decisions make up the consumer decision tree, the choices the consumer makes when making a purchasing decision.<br>
<br>
Knowing how the consumer shops the category will help retailers develop an effective merchandising strategy. This is information that should be supplied by the manufacturer, assuming it knows its customers' needs.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Ever wonder what differentiates top consumer packaged goods companies from the competition?<br>
<br>
Here's the answer: The GMA recently released a study titled &quot;Winning Where It Matters,&quot; based on its 2012 Customer and Channel Management&#xa0;survey.<br>
<br>
Even in a changing and challenging retail landscape, the survey results suggest that &quot;a company employing winning practices can successfully tackle external challenges and set itself apart from the competition.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does this mean for natural retailers and manufacturers?<br>
<br>
This is good news for progressive companies interested in taking a leadership role in its categories and with its retail partners. The competitive landscape is growing increasingly more challenging and the big differentiator is a solid strategic plan.<br>
<br>
How do you achieve this? &quot;By placing forward-looking strategic bets, leveraging data and advanced analytics to drive decision-making, collaborating more effectively with top retail customers, and building industry-shaping capabilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other characteristics of winners according to the report:<br>
*Companies that are 50% more likely to invest in sales technology and five times more likely to view retailer collaboration as a strategic priority.<br>
*Winners don't rely on tools alone: They complement quantitative analysis with quantitative insights.<br>
*Winners monitor performance and manage brokers on a more granular level.<br>
<br>
Important lessons for the natural channel<br>
<br>
The natural channel is the incubator for the healthy living movement. The opportunities are great for any company willing to invest in its future and&#xa0;willing to take a leadership role in our industry.<br>
<br>
This means maximizing all available resources, owning every part of the sales process, relying more heavily on their own sales people than on brokers, maximizing efforts at shelf, developing targeted marketing programs that drive customer traffic, and paying particular attention to core consumer's wants and needs.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Should you hire a targeted business consultant beyond your broker and distributor? Here are the reasons why, plus what to look for when hiring.<br>
<br>
It's nearly impossible to be a true expert in every aspect of your natural business. Consultants are a great way to fill in the gaps and add value. A business consultant is any advisor who provides advice and support, including brokers and distributors.<br>
<br>
Why hire a consultant?<br>
<br>
In an ever-changing economy, consultants can identify hidden opportunities that you may have overlooked or didn't know about. Consultants can provide you with a competitive advantage while reducing costs and streamlining processes, and help provide a gateway to targeted retailers. A talented consultant can be worth his or her weight in gold.<br>
<br>
&quot;But,&quot; you say, &quot;my broker and distributor provide all the services I need.&quot; &#xa0;<br>
<br>
Brokers and distributors provide a valuable service to the natural industry. Without them, many natural and mainstream brands would not find their way to store shelves. Brokers and distributors wear many hats including retail and administrative support.<br>
The challenge is that they typically represent multiple clients at retail and have limited resources that need to be spread between those clients. Unfortunately, they can't be experts in everything.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a specialist is needed to help differentiate your brand and help you take a leadership role in the category. An analogy might be the difference between a general physician verses a neurosurgeon. It&#x2019;s sometime wise to use both a generalist and a specialist, as they both provide value but in different areas.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
How do you maximize your broker/consultant ROI?<br>

    As natural competition increases so does the expectation retailers have of the brands they carry. Does your sales story resonate?<br>
<br>
Most companies tend to focus its message on what's important to them. Unfortunately, few take the time to build the message around their customers' needs. The same holds true for retailers.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
A lot of the natural products on retailer shelves today are distributed because the buyer liked the sales person. This is called &#x201c;relationship selling.&#x201d; In this instance, little thought or science is put behind the purchasing decision. Decisions are based primarily on emotion and gut as opposed to facts.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Fact-based selling relies on the relationship but is supported by solid facts that support the benefit to the consumer as well as the retailer. This can include the brand's commitment and plan to support the retailer, the market, the category, consumer insights, the potential sales for the item, schematic recommendations and more. &#xa0;<br>
<br>
Decisions based solely on item performance sometimes undervalue consumer buying habits along with their needs and wants.&#xa0;It can actually reduce category sales.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Your sales story on (natural) steroids<br>
<br>
In today's highly competitive environment, retailers want to know a lot more than the different colors or flavors of a product. They also want to know who buys the product, how it will help them grow category sales and drive traffic into their store, and how the new item will impact the bottom line.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
To differentiate your brand from the other brands&#xa0;on the shelf, consider adding facts to your sales story.&#xa0;Do this by incorporating a mini-category review into each selling opportunity, including new item presentations.<br>

Successful product promotions don't just grow sales. Here's what you should consider before running your next promotion.<br>
<br>
Almost every CPG company runs promotions but are they always effective?&#xa0;<br>
<br>
The truth is, less that 50 percent of promotions are effective. Most companies promote their products without a clear strategy to grow sales and increase brand awareness. While it's important to support key retailers, a promotion that doesn't increase sales and foot traffic in the category is simply a waste of money.<br>
The kind of sale you want<br>

    How do you make the most of your external data on sales, shipment, inventory, consumer insights and more? Here are five questions to ask data providers.<br>
<br>
Analyzing data can be extremely confusing for manufacturers, but it doesn't need to be.&#xa0;Think of data as business intelligence.&#xa0;What are your needs and objectives?&#xa0;What questions do you want answered?&#xa0;This will help you determine where to start.<br>
<br>
There are several data sources available to any manufacturer:&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Internal data includes your shipment data (data that tracks the movement of your products to distributors and retailers); your promotional data (trade spending including all the costs associated with a promotion); and inventory data (your inventory of products ready to be shipped). &#xa0;<br>
<br>
External data includes syndicated data, consumer data, retailer point of sale data (POS) and distributor/wholesaler data. &#xa0;<br>
<br>
Data can be viewed in several ways.&#xa0;Some companies offer basic, canned reports that are great for a quick reference/review of your sales.&#xa0;Topline reports, however, do not give you a competitive advantage. Custom reports offer a specialized in-depth look at your business and are the single best tools to help manage your business and grow your brand.<br>

How do you make the most of all this data? Here are the five key questions to ask your data provider:<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Consumer decision trees could be the difference between a strong committed loyal customer and an occasional shopper. What is it and why should you use one?<br>
<br>
The consumer decision tree, which shows how consumers shop a category, is perhaps the most difficult concept for retailers and manufacturers to act on. However, understanding consumer buying habits gives retailers and manufacturers a leg up on the competition and demonstrates their commitment to satisfy their customers.<br>
<br>
Essentially, the consumer decision tree identifies and prioritizes all the decisions a consumer makes while shopping.&#xa0;Conversely, a poorly constructed consumer decision tree serves to only frustrate and alienate customers.<br>
<br>
Benefits for retailers<br>
Consumer decision trees seek to understand how customers shop the retailer. Most stores are laid out in a &#x201c;race track&#x201d; format with staples positioned around the outside of the store; produce, deli, dairy, meat, seafood and bakery. The center of the store usually includes dry grocery and health and beauty aids. Items in these sections are designed to augment choices made on the outside of the store. Margins for the retailers are typically higher along the &#x201c;race track&#x201d; as opposed to center store.<br>
<br>
A well-constructed consumer decision tree gives the retailer an opportunity to encourage up selling. For example, merchandising&#xa0;super-premium items next to category favorites. Consumers are happy to pay extra for items with a greater perceived value.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Benefits for manufacturers<br>
Manufacturers typically spend a lot of money hiring independent third-party consultants to construct consumer decision trees. The trees include research on how consumers shop and how they perceive the importance of each segment within the category. These models are typically extremely accurate and capable of increasing consumer loyalty within the brand and retailer.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    There are essentially two types of retailers, those so focused on the four P&#x2019;s that they overlook the fifth, and retailers that focus on people first. The difference highlights their commitment to making the shopping experience more enjoyable and easier to their loyal customers.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Some retailers choose product assortments that feature a few select brands, while others choose product assortments that address the needs and wants of their customers. While the first restricts choices and usually tries to encourage consumers to support the retailer&#x2019;s private-label, the second strategy provides a good representation of available brands.&#xa0; It doesn't attempt to limit consumer&#x2019;s choices.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Think about how your customers shop your store. &#xa0;Few of your customers are committed natural shoppers.&#xa0; They are looking to the retailer to educate them on the benefits of the &#x201c;healthy for you products&#x201d;.&#xa0; They want a store that is easy to shop. A properly executed merchandising strategy will build loyalty with your existing consumers while making new customers feel welcome.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Here's why manufacturers should put as much effort into sales and retailer relationships as they do developing their natural products.<br>
<br>
Selling in the natural channel means wanting more: greater transparency; simple easy-to-read and understand labeling; high-quality ingredients; a commitment to fair trade; a high degree of integrity in the way we conduct ourselves; and a commitment to sustainability.&#xa0;<br>
The level of innovation and creativity that companies put into their brands, their packaging, the company name and the products they sell is impressive. The harsh reality is that consumers won&#x2019;t buy what they can't find. Companies need to put an equal amount of effort, passion and enthusiasm toward their efforts with the retailer.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
This then begs the question: Why wouldn't you put the same passion and energy into growing your business as you put into your products?<br>
<br>
Most companies say that they want more sales. While some companies don't know where to find solutions, others make excuses such as, &quot;It's worked in the past&quot; or &quot;Everyone else is doing it this way.&quot;&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Are you happy with the status quo?<br>
<br>
If you continue doing what you've always done the results will always be the same.<br>
<br>
Are you happy with your sales growth? Do you have full distribution of all your key items? Are you happy with the return you get for each promotion? If you can't answer these questions with an emphatic &quot;Yes!&quot; then it's time to re-think your go-to-market strategy.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Can't afford to run a loyalty program in your store? Turn to social media instead to foster loyal customer relationships.<br>
<br>
The cornerstone of retail is the 4P's: product, placement, promotion and pricing. The perfect balance of these will increase consumer traffic in your store, build consumer loyalty and help you remain competitive in any economy. &#xa0;<br>
<br>
The challenge for some retailers is that they are so focused on the 4P's that they overlook the fifth: people. Retailers focused on people (the customer) are committed to making the shopping experience more enjoyable and easier for their loyal customers. They put the consumer first&#x2014;always.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Some mainstream retailers rely on club cards and loyalty cards to connect with core customers. Their programs reward loyal customers for shopping at their stores. Some provide discounts, reduced gasoline prices, special incentives and custom couponing. The programs do a good job keeping the retailer connected with the consumers through regular mail, emails, phone apps and more.<br>
<br>
But consumer loyalty programs can be very complex, expensive, difficult to manage and even more difficult to implement. They're usually not a good fit for the small retailer.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Using social media to create loyalty<br>
<br>
Smaller retailers, especially natural retailers, can effectively use social media to remain connected to their consumers. The best part: Many social media tools are free. An effective social media campaign can be every bit as effective as the larger mainstream grocer&#x2019;s loyalty programs.&#xa0;

    Strategic category management can help drive sales. Follow these expert tips to get the highest return.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Gluten free. Raw. Functional foods. Nondairy milks. Nut and seed butters. Energy bars. Body washes. Given the incredible amount of new product launches&#x2014;more than 39,000 introduced in the U.S. in 2011 and nearly 24,000 in 2012 through July, according to global market research firm Mintel&#x2014;it&#x2019;s no wonder retailers need a way to get a handle on the mad marketplace.<br>
<br>
Natural industry strategic advisor<br>
<br>
1.) Mix it up. Stock the right assortment of products to keep your current customers happy and increase foot traffic. Your mix should include top-selling items found at other retailers in your market as well as niche and specialty goods. New customers will want to search for their favorite brands before trying new products. Your goal is to satisfy all of your customers&#x2019; needs while they shop in your store.<br>
<br>
2.) Define category purpose. Identify the role you want a category to play within your store. A category can be used to gain new customers, support routine shopping needs, create a destination for seasonal and occasional purchases, offer a one-stop shop or provide convenience. You may assign a different function to each category depending on the type of customer you want to attract. Build your sales strategies around this important step.<br>
<br>
3.) Differentiate from your competition. Large conventional retailers do a lot of things right. But instead of competing with them on price alone, focus on what natural products stores can do better, such as offering superior customer service, knowledgeable sales support, healthier products, community commitment and more selection. In other words, exceed your customers&#x2019; expectations.&#xa0;<br>

    According to a recent article in Supermarket News (&#x201c;Wal-Mart to in vest $6 Billion Price&#x201d;),Wal-Mart has made a commitment to be the recognized low price food retailer in 31 markets. Their efforts include TV ads comparing Wal-Mart prices to other key retailers including Safeway, Kroger, Walgreens and others.&#xa0;The commercials focus on the cost savings from shopping at Wal-Mart compared to shopping at the competition by comparing actual register receipts.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Tom Peters, in his book titled &#x201c;In Search Of Excellence&#x201d;, states that &#x201c;bigness is automatically badness&#x201d;. He was talking about the inability of large corporations to be nimble and easily meet the consumer&#x2019;s ever-changing needs. Wal-Mart&#x2019;s sheer size makes it difficult for the retailer to compete head-to-head with others on their competitors &#x201c;turf&#x201d;. In other words, don't fight the battle Wal-Mart wants to draw you into. Instead, focus on your strengths. This is good news for smaller retailers, especially natural retailers.&#xa0;<br>

    The perfect balance of the 5P's will increase consumer traffic in your store, build consumer loyalty, and help you remain competitive in any economy.<br>
<br>
The 5P's (planning, promotion, placement, pricing, and people) are the cornerstone of any solid retail strategy. This is true for both manufacturers and retailers. Working together, they can develop strategies that benefit both.&#xa0;The primary objective of any strategy should be to create loyal committed customers.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Consumers are inundated by offers from competing retailers every day. Most consumers cherry-pick specific retailers to fill only part of their needs. A solid strategy should include addressing as many consumer needs as possible; the goal is to keep them shopping at your store instead of your competitor.<br>

    Take advantage of these simple merchandising strategies and make it easy for customers to shop your store frequently.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Proper item placement can be the difference between success or failure for any brand, item and even retailer. Consumers want&#xa0;stores that are easy to shop and sections that are well merchandised. Busy customers hate scavenger hunts. They appreciate retailers with clean, well-organized and easy to shop stores.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
One way to achieve this is to merchandise like items together with a similar theme or function, such as gluten-free. These categories appeal to very specific consumers who&#xa0;are typically committed, loyal shoppers, willing to spend more than the average consumer to buy quality products that meet a specific need. According to a recent study done by Boulder Brands, &#x201c;A gluten-free shopper spends about three times more per store visit.&#xa0; The gluten-free shopper spends almost $100 and the average American shopper spends about $30.&#xa0; However, if the section isn&#x2019;t there, they are going to leave.&#x201d; These are your best customers and are definitely worth your focus.<br>
<br>
A savvy retailer will dual merchandise top items from the sections within regular categories. This strategy invites customers to try new items and to learn about products that support specific needs such as gluten free. For example, merchandise gluten-free crackers in both the gluten-free section and the cracker category. Once your customers try and like a gluten-free item, they might then try other gluten-free items. Then they become one of your committed loyal gluten-free shoppers.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    You've worked hard to become a category leader and get on the shelf, but are you maintaining and protecting your shelf placement?<br>
<br>
You've worked hard to develop a great product that will revolutionize the category and meet unmet consumer needs. You've managed to gain distribution at key retailers and consumers love your product. So, what are you doing to keep your product on retail shelves?&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Most manufacturers and retailers put all their effort and energy into getting a product on the shelf. Few put as much energy into keeping it there. This is a huge mistake that can ultimately affect the strength of your entire brand portfolio.<br>
<br>
Getting the product on the shelf is sometimes easier than keeping it there. Some manufacturers rely on brokers and distributors to manage their distribution. While this can be an effective strategy to getting your product on the shelf, it is not necessarily the best strategy to manage the an ongoing relationship with the retailer.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
For this reason, I recommend that manufacturers partner with their brokers and distributors to work closely with the retailer to help support your brand. Together, you can aggressively work to develop, implement and execute strategies to grow sustainable sales for both you and the retailer. You can leverage their strengths to maximize your growth.&#xa0;<br>

    An effective pricing strategy can be the difference between being perceived as a market leader or follower. Which of these strategies do you use?<br>
<br>
An effective pricing strategy can be the difference between being perceived as a market leader or follower. The wrong strategy can strip margin and make it difficult to survive or push consumers away encouraging them to shop your competition. Similar to the story &#x201c;The Three Bears,&#x201d; consumers will shop around to find the price that&#x2019;s &#x201c;just right.<br>
<br>
The goal in retail is to keep existing customers coming in while inviting new customers to shop your store. Your pricing strategy has the power to convert new customers into loyal committed shoppers and should be collaboration with manufacturers. &#xa0;&#xa0;<br>
 &#xa0;&#xa0;<br>
To achieve this goal, your pricing strategy must have elements that clearly communicate your commitment to being a leader in the community and the market. Top selling items in each category should be priced equal to or very close to your competitors. This allows consumers to compare your prices against another store, giving them the perception that your prices are fair. When combined with a strong brand strategy, this allows you to compete more effectively with other retailers in your market. For example, the top-selling diaper brand &#x201c;Widgets&#x201d; is priced similar at all the stores in the market&#x2014;including your store.<br>

    As Kroger pledges to lead in natural products retail, it's time for natural retailers to unite in order to stay relevant&#x2014;and in business.<br>
<br>
Kroger recently announced its commitment to becoming the leading retailer of natural products. More than ever before, it's time that natural retailers unite to take a proactive leadership role in the natural industry. <br>
<br>
The news goes well beyond disagreements on the definition of &quot;natural&quot; or the importance of non-GMO. This cuts to the very heart of our industry and challenges our future. <br>
<br>
Kroger's announcement means greater opportunities for top-selling brands to be represented at their stores. While I applaud their commitment to natural brands, their success could potentially stifle local and national natural retailers' growth. This will also have a dramatic impact on small local and regional natural brands.<br>
<br>
Mainstream retailers like Kroger cherry pick the top-selling natural brands in addition to providing a wide variety of natural private label items. Their reach and their ability to connect with consumers is far greater than even Whole Foods Market.<br>
<br>
This is an unparalleled threat to the natural products industry. Kroger has some of the strongest consumer loyalty rates in the entire food industry. Their true strength is converting consumers to loyal shoppers. The Organic Trade Association states that 54 percent of organic food sales were in mainstream retailers (in 2010). That number will only continue to grow.<br>
<br>
It's time that natural retailers maximize each and every selling opportunity. This means turning occasional shoppers into committed loyal shoppers.<br>

    There is a shift happening in our community. More consumers are shopping for natural products from mainstream retailers. Kroger is committed to becoming the leading retailer of natural products.  The Organic Trade Association states that 54% of organic food sales in 2010 came from conventional retailers while natural retailers were responsible for only 39%. Kroger's move comes as more large grocery chains look to meet ramped-up consumer demand for organic and natural foods, said Nate Filler, president and CEO of the Ohio Grocers Association. This represents a tremendous competitive threat to natural retailers. <br>
<br>
This also means more opportunities for top-selling brands to be represented in a greater number of stores across multiple channels. While this is an incredible for opportunity for top natural brands, the growth in mainstream retailers could potentially stifle natural retailers' growth. This will have a dramatic impact on small local and regional natural brands.<br>
<br>
Mainstream retailers like Kroger cherry-pick the top selling national brands in addition to providing a wide variety of natural private label items. Their reach and their ability to connect with consumers is far greater than any other retailer including Whole Foods Market.<br>
<br>
The challenge mainstream retailers face is choosing the right assortment that meets their customer&#x2019;s needs. Mary Ellen Adcock, Kroger's Vice President of Natural Foods Division stated, &quot;It's easy for them (consumers) to find natural and organic products that they know they can trust, and to have more choices of both ... choice drives incremental sales.&quot; This creates an opportunity for top natural brands to win-over mainstream consumers and build a loyal following that will help support natural retailers.<br>

    Private label growth has stalled, but that doesn't mean consumers aren't looking for private label on your shelves.<br>
<br>
Private label growth has stalled according to the SymphonyIRI Group's MarketPulse survey, &quot;Reversal of Fortune: National Brands Pick Up Gains on Private Label.&quot;<br>
Nearly half (47%) of consumers buy more private label today than they did before the economic downturn began, while one-in-three U.S. shoppers is actively seeking out store brands in an effort to save money, reads the report.<br>
<br>
However, national brands are growing share despite innovative new private-label offerings. This is largely due to branded products becoming more competitive while being able to better highlight their value and benefits compared to private label.&#xa0;So, is&#xa0;private label&#xa0;going away?<br>

    A &quot;one size fits all&quot; merchandising strategy won't work in today's competitive environment. Here are seven merchandising strategies for natural manufacturers and retailers.<br>
<br>
Merchandising strategies are a valuable component of any retailer&#x2019;s success, but a &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; approach will not work in today's competitive environment. Strategies should vary by category and sometimes by segment depending on the overall objective for the brand, category and retailer. Each strategy should be carefully crafted to target a specific objective such as increasing foot traffic, inviting new customers to try your brand, developing loyal committed customers or increasing sales.<br>
<br>
Developing and managing&#xa0;merchandising strategies should be a collaborative effort shared between the retailer and the manufacturer. Manufacturers are the true experts in their brand&#x2019;s categories.&#xa0; A smart retailer should take full advantage of the manufacturer&#x2019;s knowledge and expertise to help grow the category and sales.<br>
<br>
The category captain role is a key factor in a savvy retailer&#x2019;s success. This person is a trusted business partner and ally to the retailer. Together, the retailer and manufacturer can help satisfy a greater number of consumers, grow the category, increase consumer takeaway and beat the competition.<br>
<br>
Strategies include a variety of components: pricing, promotion, product placement, ad support, consumer education, etc. Together, the different components help achieve the retailer&#x2019;s goal. Here are seven to try.<br>

True category management is the great equalizer between companies of all sizes. In 2013, it's time to invest in and develop strong category management strategies.<br>
<br>
Most companies in the natural channel don't fully understand how category management principles can help them grow sustainable sales and compete head-to-head with any Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) company. <br>
<br>
Category management is far more than pulling canned reports, keeping store shelves full or populating templates. True category management involves adopting advanced strategies to help target core consumers by satisfying their wants and needs better than the competition. It grows the category at the retail level in addition to the brand level and enables small natural brands and retailers to compete head-to-head with the largest mainstream retailers and brands on the planet.<br>
<br>
A comparison might be the difference between a major league baseball team and a high school rec-league. My mission is to level the playing field between natural and conventional with my articles. <br>

Natural products, healthy living and &quot;better for you products&quot; will continue to be the hot new trend well into next year. Most every retailer is jumping on the bandwagon. The challenge is that not every retailer is fully committed to the strategy of developing this opportunity. The retailers that adopt a solid plan and commit to satisfying the natural consumer&#x2019;s needs will position themselves to grow sustainable sales.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of studies highlighting the explosive growth in natural/ healthier/&#x201c;better for you&#x201d; products while traditional grocery items are declining in many categories. The committed natural consumer wants a lot more than just a natural claim on a label. They want full transparency and to be able to pronounce all of the ingredients on the package. This is important to know as conventional retailers strive to understand and learn more about the natural consumer. These staunch advocates are leading the way in changing the industry and the food that we eat through initiatives and trends like Just Label It, Non-GMO, fair trade, whole grains and gluten free, among others. <br>
<br>
Retailers need to understand these initiatives and how they came about to better know the committed natural consumer. They can provide valuable insights into what consumers think and want. Retailers that commit to fully addressing the needs of the natural consumer will gain a better share of this growing segment, especially as &#x201c;non-natural&#x201d; consumers embrace this initiative. <br>

There is a shift happening in our community. More consumers are shopping for natural products from mainstream retailers. Kroger is committed to becoming the leading retailer of natural products.  The Organic Trade Association states that 54% of organic food sales in 2010 came from conventional retailers while natural retailers were responsible for only 39%. Kroger's move comes as more large grocery chains look to meet ramped-up consumer demand for organic and natural foods, said Nate Filler, president and CEO of the Ohio Grocers Association. This represents a tremendous competitive threat to natural retailers.<br>
<br>
This also means more opportunities for top-selling brands to be represented in a greater number of stores across multiple channels. While this is an incredible for opportunity for top natural brands, the growth in mainstream retailers could potentially stifle natural retailers' growth. This will have a dramatic impact on small local and regional natural brands.<br>
<br>
Mainstream retailers like Kroger cherry-pick the top selling national brands in addition to providing a wide variety of natural private label items. Their reach and their ability to connect with consumers is far greater than any other retailer including Whole Foods Market.<br>
<br>
The challenge mainstream retailers face is choosing the right assortment that meets their customer&#x2019;s needs. Mary Ellen Adcock, Kroger's Vice President of Natural Foods Division stated, &quot;It's easy for them (consumers) to find natural and organic products that they know they can trust, and to have more choices of both ... choice drives incremental sales.&quot; This creates an opportunity for top natural brands to win-over mainstream consumers and build a loyal following that will help support natural retailers.<br>

    Meet your business goals in 2013 with these 10 New Year's resolutions for natural manufacturers.<br>
<br>
As you begin to develop your business strategy for 2013, it's wise to first reflect on the prior year: Did you reach your goals? &#xa0;Did you achieve all your business objectives? What would you have done differently given the opportunity? &#xa0;Did your actual results match the goals/projections you set? &#xa0;<br>
This is the first place to start when building your 2013 business strategy.&#xa0;Then, look at the goals themselves. Were your 2012 goals reasonable? &#xa0;Don&#x2019;t set goals that are out of your reach. For example, if you grew sales 5 percent in 2012, don&#x2019;t set a goal of 50 percent in 2013.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Your goals in 2013 should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely.&#xa0;Resolutions are similar to goals. &#xa0;They encourage and motivate us. Set your business goals six months ahead on the calendar in order to give yourself time to achieve them.<br>

    Meet all your customers' wants and needs with a &quot;discipline-at-shelf&quot; strategy for merchandising your retail displays.<br>
<br>
The secret to success for most items is that they are easily found by consumers. Simply put, if your item isn't on the shelf, consumers can&#x2019;t buy it.<br>
<br>
&#x201c;Disipline-at-shelf&#x201d; means having a merchandising plan for retail displays that meets your customers' needs and wants.&#xa0;Having the right assortment, or product mix, is what drives sales and ultimately satisfies consumers and keeps them coming back.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
Another important factor is ensuring that you have the right quantity on the shelf: not enough of an item can lead to out-of-stocks while too much will limit your selection and increase your inventory costs.<br>
<br>
The item-cost ratio is referred to as an item's space to sales. The object is to maximize your space to sales for each item, category and for the entire store. This needs to be balanced between the need to satisfy your customers and offer a competitive set of items also offered by your competition. The competitive set should include top selling items available across the market.&#xa0;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Customers want what they want when they want it. Here's how out-of-stocks could be crippling your natural store's revenue.<br>
<br>
Several years ago, a study from RIS News and IHL Group found that mainstream retailers lose $93 billion in annual sales due to out-of-stock products. The two biggest reasons why? Buyers' planning mistakes and store management failing to execute. As a result, reducing out-of-stocks has been a major focus for traditional CPG ever since, but natural CPG can also benefit.<br>
<br>
The pitfalls of out-of-stocks<br>
<br>
Out-of-stocks continue to be a huge problem in the natural channel, especially during promotions. It can even cause consumers to shop elsewhere. That equates to lost sales and/or a lost opportunity to bring new customers into the category. While consumers typically shop at many stores across several channels, the objective for the savvy retailer is to meet all their customer&#x2019;s needs in a single trip. Out-of-stocks greatly reduce the likelihood of this happening.<br>
<br>
Plus, promoting a brand that a consumer can't find on the shelf is a huge waste of money and gives customers a negative impression of the brand and your store. Some customers will only give a brand one opportunity to convince them of a repeat purchase. Out-of-stocks make brands especially vulnerable to being discontinued at retail.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    The natural products industry has enjoyed significant growth from being in the global spotlight. The signs are everywhere. You can't turn on the TV, listen to the radio or read a blog or newspaper without somebody touting the benefits of organic. Combined with staunch advocacy and awareness for purer/healthier &quot;better-for-you&quot; product alternatives, organic is now the center of national conversations.<br>
<br>
What's next is for the natural products industry to take a leadership role in its own growth and development. You've probably heard the phrase, &quot;Lead, follow or get out of the way.&quot; Our industry can no longer afford to be pulled into the mainstream. <br>
Traditional CPG companies should not have the largest voice in marketing and merchandising natural and organic products. Smaller companies may have fewer resources at hand, but they can still take steps to participate in the discussion, if not lead it.<br>

What will it take for organic growth in 2013?<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Instead of a canned, topline &quot;one size fits all&quot; report, seek out custom data that can help you maximize sales of your natural products.<br>
<br>
Everybody loves the promise of a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution. But the reality is that no two natural businesses are alike and each requires different solutions. <br>
<br>
A lot of solution providers claim to offer all the answers for you to grow your business. There are a plethora of topline/canned reports that are a great, quick, overview of your competition, their sales performance, the market and anything that might affect your sales.<br>
<br>
At first glance, topline reports will answer some of your important questions. However, the challenge is that your business is a lot more complex than any canned or topline reports can address.<br>
<br>
That's because topline reports:<br>
&#x2022;	Are designed to work for everyone equally&#x2014;including your competition<br>
&#x2022;	Do not give you a competitive advantage<br>
&#x2022;	Are generic and do little to answer most pressing business questions<br>
&#x2022;	Are frequently hard to read and understand<br>
&#x2022;	Don't provide actionable insights<br>
<br>
Most solution providers offer little support, if any, on such reports. All the data in the world is only as good as the person who interprets it, which is why it's wise to consult with an expert who can help you maximize your results.<br>
<br>
Data that helps grow your business<br>
<br>
Imagine reading a report that tells you that your business is healthy nationally, but fails to identify threats and specific markets where you're losing share to your competition. Wouldn't it be more helpful to identify a potential threat before the competitors take your sales? The right reports will help you proactively manage your business and crush your competition.<br>

Other retailers are moving in this direction, including Safeway. Some stores in the national chain now feature unique merchandising schemes for gluten-free products. Here, separate displays can be justified as a retailer&#x2019;s attempt to avoid cross-contamination, or simplify the shopping process, say experts.<br>
<br>
&#x201c;There are sections like gluten free which benefit from segregation because the consumer looking for these products has a very specific, exact need,&#x201d; said Dan Lohman, strategic advisor at Category Management Solutions.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the broader natural and organic categories, however, segregation isn&#x2019;t as simple a decision. The wide variety of products needs to be presented in such a way that the consumer is still willing to shop the &#x201c;store within a store.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a format that can fall flat if not properly executed, experts say.<br>
<br>
In Giant&#x2019;s case, the section has been dubbed Nature&#x2019;s Promise, named after the chain&#x2019;s private-label line of natural/organic products. Many of the items have representation in the new aisle. Indeed, store brands are another key reason why segregated merchandising is on a rebound of sorts.<br>
<br>
&#x201c;There are really a lot of retailers out there pushing their private label because that&#x2019;s how they make some good money,&#x201d; said Lohman.

    Category management is the great equalizer between small businesses and the most sophisticated CPG companies. Is your natural store using it to the fullest?<br>
<br>
There is a huge difference between natural and mainstream when it comes to category management. I use the term &quot;true&quot; category management to differentiate the difference.  True category management is an essential process that, when done properly, can determine your level of success in the marketplace. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, many natural and organic companies either overlook or say they can't afford to invest in it.<br>
<br>
Here's why you should make the investment in your natural store: Category management provides strategies to better connect with consumers, develop brands, manage trade spending, optimize product placement and grow sales. Combining business intelligence, logistics data, syndicated and POS data and consumer data, true category management maximizes business results.<br>
<br>
Category management truly is the glue that unites the different business functions.  It helps retailers identify opportunities for sustainable growth, increased sales and increased foot traffic. When done correctly, it grows brands.<br>
<br>
Are you leveraging category management to the fullest or not at all? Here are the key aspects for success:<br>

    Grow your natural manufacturing business with four analytics reports that reveal how and where your natural products are sold in retail.<br>

When it comes to category management, you may know the seven essential components, but do you know how to implement each one?<br>

Analytics<br>
<br>
Analytics, both basic and advanced, are at the heart of category management. As a roadmap to achieving your goals, they encompass all aspects of trade management, business planning, assortment analysis and consumer awareness. When applied correctly, they provide invaluable business insights and actionable recommendations.<br>
<br>
Think of analytics as the facts needed to support business-making decisions. It can provide answers to pressing business questions that will help you better support your retailer partners and grow your brand.<br>
<br>
The challenge is: Where to begin?<br>
<br>
A good place to start is to work backwards from the questions you are trying to answer. What information do you need to answer your questions? What insights do you want from the data? Do you want visual results?<br>
<br>
At this point, try not to get lost in the minutia. &quot;Analysis paralysis&quot; occurs when you try to analyze too much data, resulting in a waste of time and frustration.<br>
<br>
The next step is to become familiar with the popular reports and reporting tools available. Here are four:<br>

Trade Marketing Support<br>
<br>
Trade marketing's focus is on inviting new customers to shop your brand, encouraging consumers to choose your brand over the competition, raise brand awareness, support your retail partners and grow sales sustainably. <br>
<br>
Trade marketing support includes everything from grass roots initiatives to full blown ad campaigns, and analysis of historical events as well as projections for future sales trends.<br>
<br>
A recent study by Nielsen claims that less than half of all trade promotions fail to increase brand or category growth. This is unfortunate, because the main goal of trade marketing is to do just that&#x2014;grow one's brand by increasing the demand at the retailer/distributor level.<br>
<br>
Trade marketing is typically the largest line item on a company balance sheet, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's effective. True category management can help you get a higher ROI for your trade-marketing budget and effectively reach your target consumer.<br>

    Consumer insights<br>
<br>
Includes all consumer-related information around consumer buying and shopping habits. From a retailer reducing long checkout lines to a manufacturer providing the best selection of merchandise at the best possible price, the ultimate goal is to improve customer satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Similar to the famous movie line &quot;If you build it they will come,&quot; consumer insights identify specific attributes that encourage repeat purchase of product. In this example, an endless supply of baseball's top players.   <br>
   <br>
Shopper insights<br>
<br>
Consumer insights frequently get confused with shopper insights. Shopper insights focus on how people shop your category, identifying the process consumers go through when selecting their favorite brand.  For example, shoppers might choose the product size before brand and flavor. Typically, brand is the first choice consumers make when creating their shopping list. <br>
  <br>
Consumer insights focus on how consumers use your products, identifying the key product attributes that help you stand out from your competition and attract new loyal customers. You might focus your product marketing as a stand alone snack while the majority of your customers mix it with other foods like granola and yogurt.  <br>
<br>
Specifically, you need to know your target consumer, what's important to them, their needs, why they choose your brand over the competition, and what keeps them loyal repeat buyers.  Becoming an expert will help you grow sustainable sales and compete head-to-head with even the most sophisticated CPG company. <br>
<br>
Both insights are extremely important in developing and implementing a brand strategy. They should also both be considered when developing a category management strategy. <br>

    The importance of independent food retailers cannot be overemphasized, but they are frequently overlooked. Some larger retailers forget that they were once small independent retailers as well. <br>
<br>
Independent retailers, and especially those in the natural space, are the lifeblood of the communities they service. They typically have a strong commitment to the community, sustainability, local schools and causes, and educating their loyal customers about brands specifically designed to meet their needs. <br>
<br>
Independent natural retailers fill a void that larger retailers can&#x2019;t meet. No one retailer can completely service every consumer&#x2019;s needs. Specialization offers choices to a wide variety of shoppers. The small independent retailer might have unique specialty items while the larger mainstream retailer can support large families with tight budgets.<br>
<br>
Independent natural retailers serve as incubators for new products and new innovation. They can also act as the &#x201c;R&amp;D departments&#x201d; for new brands, helping manufacturers understand consumer needs. Most large natural brands can trace their roots back to an independent retailer with the courage to sample their items. For this reason it is imperative that natural manufacturers pay homage to the retailers that helped launch their brands. Helping the retailer secure top-selling items in the marketplace and helping the retailer compete head-to-head with their larger competitors can accomplish this.<br>

    Database management includes the best tools to help manage your natural business and grow your brand. Here are key data types and what you can learn.<br>
<br>
When it comes to category management, you may know the seven essential components, but do you know how to implement each one?<br>
<br>
Database Management<br>
<br>
Database management, also known as business intelligence, encompasses several different data sources such as internal and external data sources, syndicated data, retailer point-of-sale data (POS), consumer data and marketing data. Talented category managers can help you bring together all the different data sources in a useful way. This will maximize efficiencies within the organization while building a strong sales story to help you win at shelf.<br>
<br>
Data management can be extremely confusing but it doesn't need to be. What are your needs and objectives?  What questions do you want answered? This will help us determine where to start.<br>
Data management includes making all of the different data sources work well for you. Similar to a chef at a gourmet restaurant, knowing how to combine spices with the different ingredients is what sets you apart from the greasy spoon.<br>

    Product placement and shelf management are crucial for driving sales and marketing to shoppers. What makes these strategies successful?<br>
<br>
Shelf Management<br>
<br>
Shelf management includes product placement and merchandising on retailer shelves. Specifically, it helps the retailer maximize sales per linear foot, drive foot traffic to stores, increase customer shopping basket size, and have a competitive advantage in their marketplace. A retailer's merchandising strategy will communicate their marketing strategy to shoppers. <br>
<br>
Effective self-management strategies can be used to communicate a consistent message to your customers, highlighting your commitment to meet their needs. It can differentiate you from your competition. Product placement is critical. Consumers want stores that are easy and friendly to shop and want their favorite brands at a fair price.<br>
<br>
Getting a product on the shelf in the right place and at the right stores is key to any brand's success. Most retailers merchandise items grouped by brand to make categories easy to shop. This strategy allows consumers to more easily compare like items.<br>

Category Reviews<br>
<br>
Category reviews serve as an appraisal of category performance. They provide the framework for retailers and manufacturers to work together in setting goals, expectations and strategic plans for future category growth. <br>
<br>
Important because they assess the state of the category compared to the goals and objectives of the retailer and manufacturer, category reviews measure a category's growth for the retailer relative to their competitive market. The market can be used as the benchmark in assessing category performance, the goal then being to grow your category faster than the market to effectively take market share from your competition.<br>

<br>
The great equalizer between smaller and more sophisticated CPG companies, true category management can differentiate any brand in today's highly competitive environment. Category managers can and should support sales within their retailer partners, and there are some different approaches to consider in doing so, some of which may prove more effective than others.<br>
<br>
Retail sales support<br>
<br>
Most natural companies rely on relationship selling. This can be extremely effective if you have good rapport with your buyers. Decisions are based primarily on emotion and gut as opposed to facts. This can also create an opportunity for sales people armed with solutions to help retailers compete more effectively. The challenge, then, comes from dealing with new buyers, strong competitive threats from more sophisticated brands and mainstream retailers who expect more support from their brands. The old way of selling is not as effective as it once was.<br>
<br>
Another hurdle is that most companies tend to focus their message on what's important to them&#x2014;their product's value from their perspective. Unfortunately, few take the time to educate their retail customers and help build the message around their needs: satisfying customers while making a profit. Retailers want support and guidance from their manufacturer partners.<br>

    It's been estimated that out-of-stocks cost retailers and manufacturers tens of billions of dollars each year. Reduce them, lost sales and annoyed customers with this advice.<br>
<br>
Several years ago a study was done to calculate the lost opportunity due to out-of-stocks in mainstream grocery. It was estimated that out-of-stocks cost retailers and manufacturers tens of billions of dollars each year. As a result, reducing out-of-stocks has been a major focus for traditional CPG.<br>
Shelves full, customers happy<br>
It continues, however, to be a huge problem in the natural channel, especially during promotions. From the consumer point of view, this is very frustrating, even causing them to shop elsewhere when they can't find what they want. To the retailer and manufacturer, that equates to lost sales and/or missed opportunity to bring new customers into the category.<br>
Besides, promoting a brand that a consumer can't find on the shelf is a huge waste of money for the manufacturer, creating a negative impression for the consumer. Some customers will only give a brand one opportunity to convince them they deserve a shot in their shopping cart.<br>

    Independent natural retailers serve as incubators for new products and innovation, for which natural manufacturers should pay homage. Conversely, it is a huge mistake for independent natural retailers to turn their back on brands if and when they gain distribution at a competitor because consumers perceive stores missing top-selling natural brands as having a poor selection.<br>
<br>
Independent, and especially natural retailers, are the lifeblood of the communities they service. Their importance cannot be overemphasized&#x2014;but is frequently overlooked. With typically a strong commitment to the community, sustainability, local schools and causes, and educating their loyal customers about brands specifically designed to meet their needs, such retailers fill a void that larger retailers can't meet.<br>
<br>
Larger natural and mainstream players typically cherry-pick the top-selling items to drive consumer traffic to their stores. Their reach and ability to invite consumers to try natural products is unparalleled. Most of them focus on converting consumers to their private-label products.<br>

    When done right, packaging can do a lot more for a brand than simply communicate a unique product offering to consumers. Here's what natural brands must consider.<br>
<br>
Packaging is the face of your brand. Not only does it identify your product on the shelf, but also tells the consumer a lot about the product inside. Your packaging should clearly communicate everything you want your brand to represent: quality, health, integrity, uniqueness, etc.<br>
<br>
Packaging can do a lot more for your brand than simply communicate your unique product offering to consumers. It can be used to develop a billboard at retail, helping consumers find your products more easily (think Lay's sea of yellow). For example: imagine if all of your packages were bright red. How would they stand out on the shelf if they were all grouped together on multiple shelves? This is a billboard and the ultimate in product placement that few brands achieve.<br>
<br>
The goal is to &quot;own&quot; the shelf and create a merchandising billboard to capture shoppers attention. Have this goal in mind as you develop your go-to market strategy.<br>

    As a natural product manufacturer, taking these necessary steps will get you toward a retail distribution home run so that you can compete with anyone, in any channel.<br>

Most of us spend our days constantly looking to make a dramatic improvement in whatever project we&#x2019;re working on. We see our competition getting ahead but can't seem to find ways in our busy schedule to keep up.

This is the second in a nine-part series exploring the components of true category management. <br>

    Do you know why shoppers come in and/or buy certain products at natural retail? Knowledge is power with the top five reasons.<br>
<br>
This is the third in a nine-part series exploring the components of true category management.<br>
The category role identifies the importance of the category to the retailer. <br>

This is the role the retailer wants the category to play within their store. A category can be used to bring new consumers into the store, increase foot traffic, support routine shopping needs, be a destination for seasonal/occasional purchases, a one-stop-shop or for convenience. Retailers may assign different roles to categories within their stores depending on the customers they want to attract.<br>
<br>
Category roles are great way of developing specific strategies to target customer needs. For example, the retailer might want to be known as the best store to support all of the needs of new parents. In this example the retailer would stock a wide variety of baby and infant products across several product segments. Their selection would be better than their competition, differentiating them in their market.<br>
<br>
Sometimes rolls vary within a category. The retailer might want to be the low price leader in certain segments within the category to draw shoppers into their store&#x2014;in our example, the lowest everyday price on baby food in the market. They would then earn a higher margin on complementary items like baby clothes, soaps and shampoos, lotions and creams, etc.<br>

    Category appraisal is similar to your yearly physical exam in that it provides a complete assessment of the category&#x2019;s overall health with a look at the five Ps: product, placement, pricing, promotion and people. <br>
<br>
The third step in eight toward mastering category management, category appraisal is similar to your yearly physical exam in that it provides a complete assessment of the category&#x2019;s overall health. <br>
<br>
Just like an airplane changes course continually as the wind blows, you frequently need to make several minor adjustments to achieve your targeted results while working toward a goal. Without continually assessing the plane&#x2019;s flight status and tweaking accordingly, it would never reach its final destination. This is also true in retail and why this step is so important. <br>
<br>
Retailers should assess their categories annually. Manufacturers should provide a complete category review each time they have a top-to-top meeting with a retailer, offering mini category reviews whenever they introduce a new item. This should always assess the category performance at the retailer, within the market and across different outlets.<br>
<br>
Category assessment focuses on the five Ps: product, placement, pricing, promotion and people.<br>

    How advanced are your goal-setting skills? Scorecarding success is only 4 steps away.<br>
<br>
This is the fourth of eight steps to mastering category management. We're halfway there!<br>
<br>
Goal setting is an important part in any business function. Without goals, how will you know when you've reached an objective? More importantly, goal setting is the roadmap to helping you achieve the results needed to successfully grow your business.<br>
<br>
Scorecarding is advanced goal-setting. The category scorecard is organized and broken down into micro goals all designed to grow category, segment, brand and item sales. Goals should also be focused on increasing consumer foot traffic in the natural store.  <br>
<br>
The completed scorecard should identify the strategic allocation of work to be performed to reach your goals and objectives, including an assessment of consumer buying habits. They should be specific, not general. The more specific the goals, the easier they are to target and assess.<br>
Goal setting should align the manufacturer&#x2019;s brand strategies for the category with the retailer&#x2019;s. Accordingly, as true category experts, manufacturers should be a key part of any scorecarding project. Together, they can help each other reach their goals for sustainable sales growth and market penetration.   <br>

<br>
Now we delve into step five of eight on the journey to true category management. <br>
<br>
Category strategies are used to fine-tune the category role to meet scorecard objectives. Strategize to grow market share, improve gross margin, gain customer satisfaction, and increase sales, foot traffic, return-on-investment and shopping basket size.<br>
<br>
Strategies give a purpose to each category, segment and brand within the retailer. They are designed around a specific goal or retailer objective. Strategies can be developed at all different levels from individual items up to and including an entire department and should align themselves around the sales process and attaining a specific goal. Those goals should be incorporated and managed with the help of our previous step, a category scorecard. <br>
<br>
To provide a unique flavor, or point of differentiation for the retailer in the market, strategies should differ within categories. <br>
<br>
Always designed with the consumer in mind, the category strategy's goal is to connect certain retailer perceptions or products with shoppers. For example, a turf-defending strategy is one that relies heavily on competitive price points for popular top-selling items. This might include snacks and soda. A commitment to sell these items at a competitive price can establish the retailer as a market leader in these categories. That will in turn draw additional foot traffic to purchase other categories in the store. It's the balance of the different strategies that fuels the store&#x2019;s sales goals and objectives. <br>

Independence Day is a huge holiday for retailers. Competition is fierce for every shopper&#x2019;s dollar. Your goal is to increase foot traffic in your store, so the strategy becomes increasing foot traffic, thus increasing sales. The tactics, then, are how you go about achieving that strategy.

    Where the proverbial &#x201c;rubber meets the road,&#x201d; the degree to which you accurately implement the plan will dictate your/its success. While this sounds easy, it is typically the most difficult step for manufacturers and retailers.&#x2028; <br>
<br>
The eighth in a nine-part series exploring the components of true category management, this is the action step that brings your strategies and tactics to life. Where the proverbial &#x201c;rubber meets the road,&#x201d; the degree to which you accurately implement the plan will dictate your/its success.<br>
<br>
While this sounds easy, it is typically the most difficult step for manufacturers and retailers. Most of us place a lot of barriers around implementing a plan: I'm too busy. Where do I begin? I'll do it tomorrow. Sales are good. I prefer to be spontaneous. I'm not good with details, etc. These are frequently nothing more than just excuses. Some prefer to wait until all the &#x201c;i&#x2019;s&#x201d; are dotted and the &#x201c;t&#x2019;s&#x201d; crossed before you implement the plan. While this is ideal it should not preclude you from reaching your goals. <br>
<br>
How important is this? There is a famous saying; &quot;those who fail to plan, plan to fail.&quot;<br>

    This is the last in a nine-part series exploring the components of true category management.<br>
<br>
You worked hard to get to this point, where you evaluate all your efforts in the previous steps to assess their effectiveness. This is the step where you analyze, measure and review the results from the previous steps. Are they moving you closer to your goal or further away? Assessment should be ongoing and used to help you refocus and make changes if necessary.<br>
<br>
On course<br>
<br>
Similar to the plane illustration in step three, an airplane traveling from California to Hawaii is off course more than 90 percent of the time due to wind shifts. The pilots continually need to make minor adjustments to keep the plane on course. The same is true for you and your plan.<br>
<br>
Running any business would be easy if you could only predict consumer purchase habits and trends, supply and demand, the actions of your competition, the weather, etc. True category management can help you solve these puzzles, thus giving you a competitive advantage.<br>
<br>
A pilot files a flight plan before each trip. In the event of a major storm, the pilot will plan to fly around it. In the same manner, a talented category manager can help you predict an increase in cold- and flu-based supplements and medications upon environmental conditions, which may translate to an increased demand for cough drops and vitamin C.<br>

    Getting the right product mix can sometimes appear to be a daunting task. Retailers must consider category/segment sales, manufacturer support, item contribution, the importance of the item to their shoppers, item distribution at competitors and markets, etc.<br>
<br>
Managing product assortment has always been a challenge. There are so many things for a retailer to consider. For example, category/segment sales, manufacturer support (the amount and frequency an item is promoted), item contribution (what the item contributes to the growth of the category), the importance of the item to their shoppers, item distribution at competitors and markets, etc.<br>
<br>
Getting the right product mix can sometimes appear to be a daunting task. For this reason, I continually advocate a strong relationship with a trusted manufacturing partner and the diligent application of true category management principals, deep diving into the category well beyond the canned topline reports when necessary.<br>
<br>
Another consideration is the category&#x2019;s size within the retailer&#x2019;s store. You may have noticed that some categories perform poorly with ample space to feature a broad selection while other categories excel with reduced space. This may seem counter intuitive, but it's the law of diminishing return suggesting that too much of a good thing is bad.<br>
<br>
For instance, nut based non-dairy shelf stable beverages are a growing segment, however contribution continues to decline. This would imply that there are too many items on the shelf competing for shoppers' sales dollars.<br>

    There's a tremendous opportunity to better understand consumer shopping behavior, the goal being to have consumers purchase more of the items on their shopping list in your store and not with competitors.<br>
<br>
Consumers typically shop multiple categories on each trip to the store, the items in their cart representing a wide selection of products available at the chosen retailer. This is called the market basket.<br>
<br>
There's a tremendous opportunity to better understand consumer shopping behavior and take full advantage of this important phenomenon, the goal being to have consumers purchase more of the items on their shopping list in your store and not with competitors. This can be accomplished through cross category promotion.<br>
<br>
Savvy retailer to the rescue<br>
<br>
Smaller manufacturers don't always have the ability to promote across different categories or brands given their limited product selection and buying power, nor do they always have the relationships or network to effectively promote with complementary items. This is where the savvy retailer can help.<br>

My favorite report for measuring category and item performance is the opportunity gap analysis. This report combines several others in one, including an item ranking comparison between both the account and the market, a cumulative dollar share report (also used to fuel the Pareto curve), and an opportunity gap analysis assessment by item/brand/category/segment, measuring item performance against the All Commodity Volume (ACV) benchmark for the account.<br>

    Category management is the art and science of connecting your products with your core consumer. It's advanced fact-based selling using every available tool to reach your target audience, increase foot traffic for your retail partners, grow sustainable market share, improve your distribution and help you win at shelf&#x2014;all of which are vitally important to your success.<br>
 <br>
The term category management has a wide array of meanings across retailers and manufactures across multiple channels. Some category managers do little more then keep retailers shelves full using canned topline reports while others help &#x201c;steer the ship.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
When I first started (before the term was coined), category management was largely about populating templates and building presentations around them. Sadly for some companies, little has changed. Back then, report building and generation took up the lion share of every category manager&#x2019;s time. Data was not well organized and segmented. Everything had to be done by hand. With today's incredibly sophisticated and automated reporting tools, much of the busy work has been taken care of.<br>
<br>
Flexing brand muscle<br>
<br>
Category management is perhaps one of the most underutilized and misunderstood resources. It's difficult to accurately gauge the true ROI derived from category management. How do you properly evaluate increased distribution nationally, improving merchandising in the top retailers, bettering price points during a feature add or increasing the size of the shopping basket when your brand is present? A talented category manager can help companies reach and exceed their goals by providing strategic direction and guidance. The true muscle of any brand is the strength of their category management department.<br>

    The old 80/20 rule takes new meaning in natural retail merchandising: 80 percent of the items in each category mirror what consumers want most; the remaining 20 percent should make a statement about the retailer and their focus in the community.<br>
<br>
All of my articles talk about creating a competitive set. This means having top-selling items on the shelves to draw new consumers into your store. But what sets you apart from the competition?<br>
<br>
Consumers compare store pricing and selection by comparing like items at each store. Their perception is what keeps them coming back or pushes them away. It&#x2019;s critical that retailers sell items that help them effectively compete in their local markets by aggressively pricing and merchandising popular items sold by your competition.<br>
<br>
I am not suggesting that every retailer be a carbon copy of their competitor. To the contrary, I recommend that about 80 percent of the items in each category mirror what consumers want most&#x2014;items available across multiple retailers and outlets. The remaining 20 percent should make a statement about the retailer and their focus in the community.<br>

<br>
Frequently the hot topic in blogs, articles and marketing slogans, the new buzzword in the industry is &#x201c;big data.&#x201d; So what is it and why should you care? Some definitions include every type of data source imaginable, from shopper, consumer, point-of-sale (POS) and syndicated to shipment, internal inventory, cost of goods sold, demographic, social media, SEO, etc.<br>
<br>
Together in the right combination, these data points provide powerful insights to help you grow your business. It's not critical that you adopt a big data strategy if you're new to category management. It is, however, important to understand the power of the data and know how to use it to ascertain actionable business building insights.<br>

    While most natural companies have a pretty good idea of their costs, they don't have a good strategy to account for the volatile pricing of some ingredients. Change that.<br>
<br>
What does it cost to make a single bag of granola, a box of cereal, a protein bar, etc.? Do you know what it costs to produce one sellable unit of your product? While most natural companies have a pretty good idea, they don't have a good strategy to account for the volatile pricing of some ingredients. This can cause brands to over or under estimate their expenses.<br>
<br>
Cost accounting<br>
<br>
The cost of an item goes well beyond totaling its ingredients, adding your labor and packaging. Knowing the true cost of an item is critical to help you identify your true profit margins, especially during a promotion. This can help you better manage costs and keep them under control. Paying close attention to ingredient prices and market conditions can also help you predict pricing fluctuations, giving you an opportunity to schedule purchases to take advantage of optimal pricing opportunities.<br>
<br>
This is called cost accounting. While this is not traditionally a category management function, it is crucial to help you determine the profitability of a promoted item.<br>

What strategies do you use to delight your customers?<br>

Topline reports are a great first step toward understanding how products are performing. They can tell you how a product ranks in a category, whether its sales are up or down.

    The leading provider of information in the natural products industry.<br>
Onsite Business Consultant supporting natural and conventional retailers, SPINS clients, and the largest natural U.S. broker (Acosta/Natural Specialty Sales) helping them more effectively understand and use SPINS data for fact based selling.  Provided support and training for their sales, marketing, management team, and for their client&#x2019;s in category management theory and principals.  <br>
&#x2022;Created several tools:	<br>
For example, I authored and created the Distribution Tracker Report for SPINS.  The Distribution Tracker is a first of its kind tool that I developed from scratch that validated the need for store level reporting.  It was instrumental in their decision to release store level data across all of their natural retailers.  Something that they had previously never done. <br>
&#x2022;Developed a popular widely-used tool for tracking client distribution, setting attainable goals, quantifying the fair share opportunity for each item in the category, and measuring sales performance for each store.  <br>
&#x2022;Created several client-oriented category management tools, category reviews, category management templates, and reference tools for SPINS that effectively help retailers and manufacturers capture their fair share of sales, efficiently manage distribution and inventory, identify and quantify incremental sales opportunities, plan effective promotions, and evaluate trade spending.<br>
&#x2022;My comprehensive knowledge in brand development, category development and management, consumer/user/insights, and consumer loyalty earned me a total of eleven &#x201c;Exceeds Expectations&#x201d; on two reviews while at SPINS.<br>
&#x2022;I have supported and directly worked with hundreds of natural, organic, specialty, alternative, and conventional manufacturers and retailers on behalf of Natural Specialty Sales and SPINS.<br>
