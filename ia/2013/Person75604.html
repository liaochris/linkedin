<p class=" description summary">
    Always open to new LinkedIn connections, I am looking specifically in Provo, Utah and in places where I can consult using Alternative Medicine. I do Brain Health and manual therapy consulting in chiropractic, physical therapy, optometry and massage therapy clinics in the US/Canada, Europe &amp; Asia. Let me know how I can help your practice or personal health.<br>
<br>
Moving to Utah to be nearer my parents, I am looking for work in Provo. My ideal job would be working with a chiropractor, medical doctor, ophthalmologist or in an office where someone could do the billing and set up the appointments with clients who have brain, spine or vision issues and are interested in exploring what manual therapy and alternative medicine can do for them. I work under my PhD (No other Utah license).<br>
<br>
I have a PhD in Integrative Medicine and am certified in Integrative Manual Therapy and Matrix Energetics. I also have extensive training in acupressure/shiatsu (Japan), craniosacral therapy (Upledger, Milne, Canadian College of Osteopathy), visceral manipulation (Barral), osteopathic manual therapy, Reiki and health coaching.<br>
<br>
My PhD focused on using manual therapy to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Clients with conditions like macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, autism, insomnia, Huntington's disease ... have seen improvements with my work.<br>

    Kimberly Burnham PhD Fundraiser &amp; Cyclist Training for 2013 Hazon Cross USA Ride 3300 Miles 9 Weeks <br>
<br>
Here is my summer in 10 minutes 3000 plus miles across the country ... http://youtu.be/S9nZNVnDGLg<br>
<br>
My personal goal is to raise $10,000 for Hazon and sustainable agriculture programs, Bicycle 3300 miles on the 2013 Hazon Bicycle Ride from Seattle, Washington to Washington, DC.<br>
<br>
Hazon is a Nonprofit; 11-50 employees; Nonprofit Organization Management Industry <br>
<br>
Hazon means Vision, a Jewish environmental organization New York City, New York<br>
 <br>
My goal: to ride the Hazon Cross USA Bicycle Ride in 2013. My plan: Cycle 9 weeks, across this beautiful country: Seattle to DC http://visualizehealth.net/SustainableAgriculture.php or directly at http://hazon.kintera.org/2013usa/kimberlyburnham<br>
<br>
Hazon means vision. If you know me you know I am all about vision - from my own eyesight recovery despite a genetic eye disease and a PhD in Integrative Medicine focused on brain health to the ability to recognize abundance and beauty. <br>
<br>
Labor day weekend 2012 Hazon succeeded in it mission, &quot;To create healthy, sustainable communities by providing transformative experiences.&quot; 96 miles, over 2 days. Riding my bike into NYC to The Jewish Theological Seminary. <br>
<br>
Life changing, goal stretching events. Inspired by thought leadership in the fields of Jewish and environmental knowledge, including Shabbat at Isabella Freedman; riding with Ruth Messinger, president, executive director of American Jewish World Service (AJWS) and a farm tour of Adamah's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) from which I get weekly vegetables , <br>
<br>
The money we raise supports multi-generational, multi-denominational environmental movement in America &amp; Israel thru innovative environmental projects, sustainable food work or running a Tu b&#x2019;Shvat seder.<br>
<br>
Donate and find out how to work with me. My goal is to raise $10,000 to create a sustainable beautiful future for you and me and all the children. <br>

<p class=" ''">
    Kimberly Burnham, here. I am a transformational author, integrative medicine specialist and bicyclist. I am working on a new project to combine my interests and would like to invite you to be part of an anthology entitled, Bicycling for Food.<br>
<br>
My grandfather died of diabetes. My uncle lost his leg to the disease shared by 18 million Americans. Avoiding their footsteps at age 55, I enjoyed a thousand shades of green in the Connecticut Berkshires in 2012, raising money for sustainable living with Hazon (&quot;Vision&quot; in Hebrew). As I crested the last hill my bicycle odometer read 53 miles. I never expected to be able to finish the ride. The experience unleashed my inner &quot;I can do it&quot; activist. Less than a month later, five pounds lighter, I rode 71 miles. Yes, I was sore but I see brilliant beauty in my health and surroundings. Now, I can imagine long Cross-USA days that begin with dipping my bicycle wheels in Seattle's Pacific Ocean and setting off on a 3300 mile journey to Washington, D.C. raising $10,000 and sharing magnificence with everyone I meet. To follow my 2013 summer bicycle ride visit http://hazon.kintera.org/2013usa/kimberlyburnham<br>
<br>
Part of what I am doing to raise money for sustainable food justice is putting together an Amazon Kindle book, that will be an anthology with 30-40 authors. There is no cost to participate and funds raised through sales will be donated to Hazon, a non-profit serving people in the sustainable agriculture field and connecting people to where their food comes from.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the book is to share stories that inspire readers to connect and preserve the natural environment, eat healthier and bicycle or exercise. For similar projects I have worked on see my Amazon Author's Page at http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Burnham/e/B0054RZ4A0 <br>
<br>
If you are interested in participating, let me know by Feb 10 and then send the follow to Kimberly Burnham theburnhamreview@juno.com by May 15, 2013 (Publication on Amazon Kindle for June, 2013).

    Kimberly Burnham PhD The Nerve Whisperer (2011). Balancing the Sleep-Wake Cycle, Sleep Better, Learn Faster, Contribute More, and Enjoy Life to Its Fullest. West Hartford, CT, The Nerve Whisperer Press.available from http://www.amazon.com/Balancing-Sleep-Wake-Cycle-Contribute-ebook/dp/B005SGIJ9K<br>
<br>
If you have sleepless nights and wake up tired, help is on the way. In this book, you will learn some quick and easy exercises to help you get a solid night's sleep, including a simple trick that guarantees a more interesting and productive day. Everything you need to know is inside <br>
<br>
In part one, you will learn how to reset your cyclical nature in as little as 10 minutes a day so you can sleep better at night and be more relaxed and productive. <br>
<br>
Even if your time were worth only $10 an hour, sleeping better for one extra hour a night and being more productive for two additional hours during the day will save you $40 after just two nights. These exercises can save you more than thirty hours of tossing and turning in the first month alone&#x2013;&#x2013;and what you can do with those extra hours of productivity is priceless.<br>
<br>
In part two, you will explore how to work a few brief activities into your day that will help you not only sleep better, but will make it easier for you to focus, learn, read, drive, and accomplish your dreams. If you spend five to ten minutes a day exploring how you feel, what you see, hear, and sense the world around you, the value and quality of your waking and sleeping hours will increase significantly.<br>
<br>
Whether you live for another 40 or 80 years, this program will increase the quality of a third of your lifetime&#x2013;&#x2013;yes, we are talking about time spent sleeping, but more importantly, this time greatly influences the other 16+ hours a day, 365 days a year, so you can feel better, think more clearly, and enjoy every moment of your life. Create your ultimate life today.

    Fractals are a mathematical description of a shape like a tree. Think for a moment about the edges of a tree, the network, the thick roots and tiny hair-like projections where the living tree contacts the earth drawing in water and nutrients. Visualize the rough bark along the trunk and branches and each leaf touching the air sucking in carbon dioxide, expelling oxygen rich air making our planet habitable for us. Now imagine all of those fractal surfaces basking in the sunlight, taking in the energy around them and transmuting in into hard wood, sticky sap, beautiful flowers and delicious fruit. Trees with their fractal shape are the ultimate manifesters turning energy into physical matter.<br>
<br>
Inspired by The Messengers of Change Program, March, 2011, I manifested a book, Our Fractal Nature, A Journey of Self-Discovery and Connection ($6.95 ISBN: 978-1-937207-01-4). It has its own free online environment with additional resources at http://www.messengerminibooks.com Book ID# 213455. <br>
<br>
Created through the Robert Evans and Susan Buckley's Messenger Mini Book Program, Our Fractal Nature is also available on Amazon as a Kindle eBook $2.99 and free to Amazon Prime members. http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Burnham/e/B0054RZ4A0 <br>
<br>
Like the meeting place of psychology and mathematical science, this one tiny book has grown into various different shapes. It has given birth to other books, blogs, radio shows, meditations, an invitation to speak at the Raising Consciousness Global Summit and more in a magical way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fractals are the unconscious mathematics of the soul.&quot;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Integrative Manual Therapy (IMT) is a hands on approach to healing and recovery. One aspect is the palpation and normalization of motilities or rhythms in the body. In a heart attack case, one way to describe CPR is: pressure in a specific location to improve a normal body rhythm. IMT therapists treat many rhythms in the body, with precise pressure in specific locations.<br>
	Sometime people ask, how can you feel different biological rhythms? It is not unlike the wine connoisseur who can taste a glass of wine &amp; tells where the grapes are grown. They are taking sensory information, taste &amp; smell and translating it into something else: a date, location, a winery. The IMT therapist takes sensory information: touch &amp; sight and translates it into something else, a tissue type, an age, and a type of dysfunction.<br>
	IMT is also a  biomechanical approach where pressure is used in specific ways to help the tissue and joint surfaces shift, decompress &amp; unwind, allowing for more space &amp; better movement. When the tension on blood vessels, nerves and other tissue is released, fluid and information flows better and facilitates recovery. IMT Therapists also use reflex points to expedite healing. <br>
	Most people would be able to tell which is the painful hip as they watched a man with bad hip pain walk. They might not be able to articulate that the sound of his foot fall is heavier on the right or that he grimaces slightly as he lands on the left foot or that his knee doesn't fully extend or his shoulder dips slightly more on the painful side. A person with left hip pain walks differently from someone with right hip pain. Most people can see the difference. The IMT therapist makes more of this information conscious and is able to articulate more of what they perceive.<br>
	As Arthur C. Clark put it, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Integrative Manual Therapy is advanced technology

<p class=" ''">
    My entry starts...When You Feel Better, You Make Better Choices ....My grandfather died of diabetes. My uncle lost his leg to the disease shared by 18 million Americans. Avoiding their footsteps, I challenged myself as I bicycled in a fundraiser for sustainable living with Hazon, a non-profit, which means &quot;Vision&quot; in Hebrew. Exhausted as I crested the last hill, my odometer read 53 miles. I hadn't imagined finishing those last miles! I was 55 years old, overweight and out of shape. In those miles and the camaraderie of &quot;Hazoniks&quot;.  The experience unleashed my inner &quot;I can do it&quot; activist and reawakened the adventurer in me,<br>
<br>
Transformative Days<br>
The next day, my attitude about what I have to give up as I age, exploded. I rode another 43 miles, bursting out of the Hudson Valley, down a steep hill into the urban jungle. I started to re-engineer my body as I thought about another day, a dozen years ago, in New York City. Less than a month later, five pounds lighter, I rode 71 miles along the New Hampshire coastline. Yes, I was sore but also proud of myself.<br>
<br>
Nine months earlier, on vacation scuba diving in Florida, I was the oldest diver on the boat. Squeezing into my wet suit, shouldering the scuba tank, stepping off the boat, I thought, &quot;I am getting too old for this. Maybe this will be my last dive ever.&quot; But here is the thing, I love scuba diving, which I have been doing for 35 years. In my forties, fulfilling a childhood dream, I even braved machine-gun tooting soldiers to dive in the Red Sea.<br>
<br>
Now, having trained on my bicycle for two months, I can visualize another life changing day fulfilling a new goal: cycling across the United States, summer 2013, sharing a message of hope and healing. I can picture nine weeks that start with dipping my bicycle wheels in the Pacific Ocean of Seattle's Puget Sound and setting off on a 3300 mile journey to Washington, D.C. I can imagine raising $10,000 for Hazon, sustainability, and community supported, nourishing food systems.

What have you written? Are there articles, blogs, eBooks, presentations, books, DVD's, audio CD's? <br>
What is the story you are trying to tell with your publications?<br>
What is the point, the message embedded in your writing?<br>
From a style perspective, consider the title of the publication, does it convey to the reader why they should read your book or read this section of your profile?<br>
Consider the message you want to convey and title the heading section of each publication with that information. If your book title is not exactly what you want to convey put that in the body of the publication section, rather than use the publication title in the section title......

Physical books, published for hundreds of years are now outnumbered by eBook or books that are downloadable to a digital reader or to a computer as a PDF file. Readers of physical and digital books are starting to see two new publication trends.<br>
 <br>
In 2011, West Hartford, CT resident, Kimberly Burnham self-published a Messenger Mini-book entitled, Our Fractal Nature, a Journey of Self-Discovery and Connection. The physical book is 3.5 x 5 inches with 64 pages and the eBook is available on Amazon Kindle. It is a very small book and could even be thought of as a large business card. What is unique about it is that it has its own website....http://pebblesinthepondbook.com/blog/transformational-authors/new-publishing-model-non-fiction-mini-books-and-anthologies/<br>

    Do you write poetry? Are you trying to figure out how to get published? Here are three ways.<br>
<br>
1. Publish a collection of your poems as an eBook on Amazon. Here is my first book of poetry: Live Like Someone Left The Gate Open by Kimberly Burnham (Sep 18, 2012) Free to Amazon Prime Members $2.99 If you make it available for a free sample download or look inside make sure your bio and list of resources are in the front.<br>
<br>
2. Get published in an anthology. There are lots of contests and some are free to enter. I highly recommend the anthologies by Inner Child Press, where three of my poems can be found.<br>

Currently training for a Cross-USA Bicycle ride, 3300 miles from Seattle to Washington, DC Summer 2013 with Hazon, which means &quot;Vision&quot; in Hebrew and supports sustainable agriculture, food justice and environmental connection. I look forward every day to what is waiting to be seen. Three quotes inform my journey. <br>
<br>
From the Buddha, &quot;If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly, our whole life would change.&quot; <br>
<br>
From Japan where she lived for four year, &quot;There are many ways to get to the top of Mount Fuji.&quot; <br>
<br>
From the Jewish leader, the Baal Shem Tov, &quot;That water was waiting from the beginning of time for someone to come and make a blessing over it and drink it.&quot;

<p class=" ''">
    Story Coach Lisa Bloom interviews storytellers and then writes what she heard. My story was Day 8 on a 100 Day Storytelling Journey. This is how Lisa Bloom from Zichron Ya'acov, Israel<br>
told my story:<br>
<br>
I had a remarkable childhood.  The Mormon Church was, in many ways, my home.  We travelled a lot, lived in many different countries but we always knew that by the first Sunday after the move, we would have already made some friends.<br>
 <br>
The Church was my home, my family, my community.<br>
 <br>
I could never have predicted that day, two years ago, when I would send the bishop a letter to ask him to take my name off the rolls of the church; that I would so completely and utterly dissociate myself from the church that I loved so much.<br>
 <br>
The Church influenced my choice of university where, ironically, I met a wonderful woman.<br>
 <br>
My father didn&#x2019;t like, condone or understand my relationship, but said &#x2018;You&#x2019;re my daughter, above all I want you to be happy&#x2019;.<br>
 <br>
So, I was out; my family and friends knew and accepted me.<br>
 <br>
At first I insisted that my Church had a &#x2018;live and let live&#x2019; attitude towards lesbians and gays.  Though I no longer attended regular services, I felt connected and secure with their stand in the issue.<br>
 <br>
But in time, I could no longer deny what I was witnessing.  I could see that the Mormon Church was contributing millions of dollars into a campaign that simply promoted fear and hatred of the gay and lesbian community.<br>
 <br>
In my university, run by my church, 74% of gay and lesbian students have considered suicide as an alternative to telling their parents and church that they are gay.  25% of gay and lesbian students have attempted suicide.<br>
 <br>
I could no longer keep quiet.  It was time to leave home.<br>
 <br>
As I wrote and delivered that letter, I severed all ties to the home, community and a lifetime of remarkable, blessed memories.<br>
 <br>
It still hurts.<br>

    Kim's Summary of How to Put an eBook up on Amazon Kindle<br>
<br>
Write your book in a word document.  Recommended Order: Title, Subtitle, Name, Introduction (Why should your audience read your book), Bio (why should your audience care, how do they benefit &amp; what should they do to work with you further?), Table of Contents, Chapters, About the Author (more, your other books, programs, call to action), Other resources.<br>
<br>
Make a TOC (In the references section of the Word document)<br>
 <br>
Save document.<br>
<br>
Save document (new name) as Rich Text Format (RTF).<br>
<br>
Make the Contents links live (so readers can jump to sections). Do this from Insert a Hyperlink tab.<br>
<br>
Make the weblinks live (also Insert a Hyperlink tab)<br>
<br>
Save your document.<br>
<br>
Save your document (new name) as a Web page.<br>
<br>
Download Amazon Kindle reader for your computer http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000426311 (for PCs)<br>
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=kcp_mac_ln_ar?docId=1000464931 (for Mac)<br>
<br>
Open the web page document with your computer's Kindle reader..<br>
<br>
Read your book. When you open it, the reader will make a new Mobi file. You will see a new folder &quot;Compiled&quot;<br>
<br>
Set up an account and upload the Mobi file to Kindle at https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/dashboard <br>
<br>
Takes 24-48 hrs for your eBook to be live. I suggest pricing it between 2.99 - 9.99 so that Amazon will pay you 70%t of sales. Other than Amazon's sales cut there is no cost for this process. (ie) no cost for publishing your eBook on Amazon.<br>
<br>
Next set up your author's page on Amazon at Author's central (also free of charge) https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/home <br>
<br>
As an example here is my author's page. http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Burnham/e/B0054RZ4A0 <br>
<br>
What do you want readers to know about you and your books. Claim any other books you have on Amazon.<br>
<br>

    how is your vision? Want to improve your eyesight? Listen in to my interview with Misa Hopkins. http://misahopkins.com/community/ Women of Power and Spirit&#x2014;Inspirational Interviews Healing and Awakening In the Sacred Feminine.  <br>
<br>
Kimberly Burnham<br>
 <br>
At 28 years old, Kimberly was diagnosed with keratoconus and nystagmus. Basically it meant that her career as a photographer was being challenged by a potentially, blinding condition of the eyes. At the age of 54, she began a journey to find solutions for her vision and migraine headaches. Now she shares complementary and alternative ways to improve quality of life for those with a diagnosis of vision and nervous system disorders. Learn more about her story and the stories of thought-leaders such as Marci Shimoff, Jack Canfield, Janet Bray Atwood, and Robert Allen in the book, &#x201c;Pearls of Wisdom: 30 Inspirational Ideas to Live Your Best Life Now.&#x201d; Listen to Misa&#x2019;s interview with her. Kimberly has also co-authored, No Mistakes!: How You Can Change Adversity into Abundance along with Madisyn Taylor, Sunny Dawn Johnston, and HeatherAsh Amara. <br>
<br>
Kimberly Burnham is featured in the Women of Power and Spirit Interview Series, sharing the stage with  Lynn Serafinn, MAED, CPCC, Jewels Marshon, Reverend Ariann Thomas, Lea Chapin, Brenda MacIntyre, Deborah Dachinger, Sue London, Elizabeth Cuckson, Gloria Messenger and Misa Hopkins.

    An Exclusive Interview with The Nerve Whisperer, Kimberly Burnham (Sept 12, 2013) on LetsMote.com<br>
What kind of miracles have you seen in your patients?<br>
&quot;There is a quote from science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke: &#x201c;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#x201d; There are some who would say the miracles seen in alternative medicine practices around the world, come from advanced ways of looking at the body, and more holistic ways of approaching healing and recovery.<br>
During my PhD dissertation in Integrative Medicine on using manual therapy (hands-on work) to improve the symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, the client made significant improvements during the two week treatment period. According to his neurologist, who didn&#x2019;t know anything about the study, he improved 10-15 percent in terms of activities of daily living, balance, walking, and speech. To put this in context, the medical literature indicates that no matter what you do with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease you are likely going to get worse at a rate of four percent per year. This means this client turned the clock back three or four years on his symptoms. According to the client his back and hip pain also decreased from a 7 out of 10 to a 2 out of 10.<br>
Another client was diagnosed with a genetic brain disorder called Huntington&#x2019;s disease. Two years after her diagnosis her walking is better. Her speech is more easily understood and she walks almost every day. In addition to the hands-on therapies she is exercising and taking supplements.  Her neurologist, who is wonderful says, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand what you are doing but by all means keep doing it.&#x201d; ...

<p class=" description">
    This summer I spent nine weeks bicycling over 3000 miles from Seattle, Washington to Washington, DC. I am back working in my Integrative Medicine practice, while still trying to integrate what I learned in this challenging and deeply personal experience of life outside on the road while inside a pluralistic Jewish environmental group created by Hazon (Vision in Hebrew). Here is my 3000 mile Hazon Cross USA summer in 10 minutes http://youtu.be/S9nZNVnDGLg<br>
<br>
I use alternative medicine approaches: manual therapy (hands-on skills, Integrative Manual Therapy, CranioSacral Therapy and Osteopathic Manual Medicine), words (health coaching, visualization and meditations), distance work (Matrix Energetics and Health Coaching) and individually designed self-care programs and exercises to support healing in people with brain and spinal cord problems. My clients are seeing improvements in their back pain and fibromyalgia as well as in symptoms of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Working with clients from 95 years old with macular degeneration, Alzheimer's or dementia to children with autism, cerebral palsy or seizure disorders, I am committed to finding ways to help you increase your quality of life, energy level, creativity and brilliance as you truly live your life.<br>
<br>
I am asking all my friends and colleagues to donate even $5-$10 at www.hazon.kintera.org/2013usa/kimberlyburnham<br>
<br>
Fellow Hazon Cross USA team members include: Bernie Lofchie, Freddie Fisherman, Terry McKay,  <br>
Dena Lehmann, Ilan Levine, Hannah Seidel, Arye Zucker, Victoria S Carmona, Paul E Burnham, Elizabeth W Goldstein, Dov Langenauer, Nechama Langenauer, Gilad Muth, Rami Eisenman, Ilan Fleisher, Michael Zucker, Adrienne Winton, Danielle Morse, Garth Silberstein, Shai Brown, Jeremy Edelman, Eli Mernit, David Azose, David  Rensberg, Nigel Savage, Bruce Stanger, Raphael Rubin and more.<br>

    P'nai Or or &quot;Faces of Light&quot;, is a Jewish Renewal Congregation in West Hartford Connecticut. Lead by Rabbi Andrea Cohen-Kiener. Connection available at http://www.jewishrenewalct.org<br>
<br>
This West Hartford Jewish Renewal is associated with ALEPH: Alliance For Jewish Renewal (P'nai Or Religious Fellowship founded by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi in '62); The Reb Zalman Legacy Project, collaborative effort of Yesod Foundation &amp; Naropa University; Elat Chayyim Center for Jewish Spirituality (Isabella Freedman Retreat Center, Adamah Organic Farm, Hazon Cross USA Bicycle Ride); P'nai shORe; Temple Beth Israel; Shamash: The Jewish Network; Mandell JCC of Greater Hartford; Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford; and Jewish Lights Publishing. <br>
<br>
I have been a member of P'nai Or since 2005 and a part of the Jewish Renewal community since 2001. Summer 2013 I bicycled over 3000 miles across America with Hazon, which means vision in Hebrew. I am also a member of Shir Hamakom in Glastonbury Connecticut and the CSA Jewish Greens which provides organic vegetables from Adamah, the farm at Isabella Friedman in the Connecticut Berkshires.

    My goal: to ride Hazon's Cross USA Bicycle Ride in 2013. My plan: Cycle 9 weeks, 3300 miles across this beautiful country: Seattle to DC. <br>
<br>
Follow along on Tumblr http://hazoncrossusa.tumblr.com<br>
<br>
Hazon means vision. If you know me you know I am all about vision - from my own eyesight recovery despite a genetic eye disease and a PhD in Integrative Medicine focused on brain health to the ability to recognize abundance and beauty. <br>
<br>
Labor day weekend 2012 Hazon succeeded in it mission, &quot;To create healthy, sustainable communities by providing transformative experiences.&quot; 96 miles, over 2 days. Riding my bike with Hazon &amp; Victoria Carmona in the Berkshire hills. Then into NYC to The Jewish Theological Seminary. A stretch since my longest summer ride was 26 miles. <br>
<br>
Life changing, goal stretching events. Inspired by thought leadership in the fields of Jewish and environmental knowledge, including Shabbat at Isabella Freedman; riding with Ruth Messinger, president, executive director of American Jewish World Service (AJWS) and a farm tour of Adamah's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) from which I get weekly vegetables , I committed to ride the Hazon Cross US. The money we raise supports multi-generational, multi-denominational environmental movement in America &amp; Israel thru innovative environmental projects, sustainable food work or running a Tu b&#x2019;Shvat seder.<br>

    Better eyesight, intuition and perception leads to being able to find where you belong, build a team and create inner peace for yourself.<br>
<br>
The book Live Like Someone Left The Gate Open is an autobiolgraphical book of narrative poetry following my journey from 5th generation member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) around the world growing up as a third culture kid or global nomad. Then spending a year and a half serving as a Mormon missionary in the Tokyo North LDS Mission. After returning to Brigham Young University, I fell in love with a woman and became a lesbian. <br>
<br>
While there is a hugh divide between the Mormon church and the Gay and Lesbian (LGBTQ) community, there are ways on the individual level to find peace and understanding so that we can each contribute gifts to the world.<br>
<br>
My hope is that there will be a Mormon Spring, where members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) as an entire community or as individuals embrace their children, brothers, sister and mothers and fathers who are in the Gay and Lesbian community.<br>
<br>
We need to find a way to stop the 74 Percent of Gay and lesbian students at Brigham Young University from considering suicide as a viable alternative to coming out to parents and community. <br>
<br>
Call me if you want to talk about how we can together make the world the kind of peaceful, abundant place all of us want to live.<br>
<br>
Let me help your business create a team of people working together towards success.

<p class=" description current-position">
    Today, I travel, write, speak, teach and coach on a regular basis helping people improve their vision both literal eye health and inner vision and perception.<br>
   In my 20's, I was diagnosed with Keratoconus, a genetic condition of the eye where the cornea thins. Today, at 53, I have better vision than when I turned 40, probably better vision than when I was 12 and started wearing glasses.<br>
    For about 10 years through my 40's and early 50's, I was the Clinical Director of VisionIMT at the Center for Integrative Manual Therapy and Diagnostics, a large multi-disciplinary clinic in Bloomfield, CT. I often say, I was the director of vision services because no one could tell me it didn't work. My PhD dissertation was on using manual therapy to successfully support people with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington&#x2019;s disease, Autism and other neurological conditions..<br>
      Light sensitivity is one of the typical symptoms of Keratoconus. Today, my friends often reach for their sunglasses before I even think about where mine are. I also had severe migraines five or six times a year, weather related. I have had one in the last 10 years.<br>
     Today my goal is to continue to create healing for myself, my vision, my nervous system and overall well being as well as healing and recovery for my clients, I have used a combination of hands-on therapies (Integrative Manual Therapy, Osteopathic Manual Medicine, Acupressure), Energy Medicine (Matrix Energetics, Manual Pattern Recognition, Reiki, Visualization, Manual Fractal Therapy), Functional Approaches (Wisdom Healing Qigong, Meridian Tapping Techniques, Emotional Freedom Technique) and Eye Exercises (developed by Meir Schneider, MT and Abe Shapiro, Optometrists), Nutrition and Homeopathy.

<br>
More than nine million Americans over the age of 40 have macular degeneration. They are losing their vision, their ability to watch movies, to read inspirational books and to drive safely. Their world is getting smaller. <br>
<br>
Kimberly, who has a PhD in Integrative Medicine focused on brain health, especially Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, shines a light on vision recovery using natural methods, including her own personal story of recovering her eyesight, insights and hope. She and her clients are now able to live a Positively Sustainable Lifestyle, and enjoy the beauty in the world.<br>
<br>
Observing fractals, the repeated shapes making up the natural world, can improve your eyesight and your commitment to beauty in the world.<br>
<br>
Kimberly Burnham is the author of Our Fractal Nature A Journey of Self Discovery and Connection, as well as the upcoming book, Harnessing the Placebo Effect. Kimberly shares how we can improve our brain health and memory by observing, while seeking to understand the world around us. <br>
<br>
There is a special offer: Donate to Hazon and enjoy better vision through an individual coaching call with Kimberly Burnham. Hazon, which means Vision, is a Jewish organization committed to creating healthy, sustainable communities by providing transformative experiences. http://visualizehealth.net/Kim.php

<p class=" description past-position">
    A self-professed global nomad, I teach healing modalities internationally. I am a fifth-generation Mormon, lesbian activist, and transformational author. I speak out about how we are all connected, and I encourage both large audiences and individuals to recognize their similarities to others in order to find connection and comfort. One of my personal mantras is, &#x201c;Do what you feel passionate about.&#x201d;  My message is strengthened through personal experience of diversity, having grown up in the US, Colombia, Belgium, Japan, and Canada. <br>
<br>
I am also known as The Nerve Whisperer. Under this name, I consult in physical therapy, massage, and chiropractic clinics, sharing skills and knowledge reinforced by a PhD in Integrative Medicine focused on brain health. I also encourage clients with my personal story of recovery from chronic migraines and a genetic eye disease. I chronicle this recovery and my clinical practice in &#x201c;The Eyes Observing Your World,&#x201d; a chapter included in Christine Kloser's Pebbles in the Pond: Transforming the World One Person at a Time (2012). Every morning I wake up between the quantum particles of past realities and inspiring waves of future possibilities, and that is where I create healing.<br>
<br>
My views have been shaped by global experiences, like the weeks I spent in the Middle East around September 11, 2001, or when, at 24 and with love and a kiss, I bridged the divide between being a dedicated Mormon missionary and a lesbian activist. <br>
<br>
Part scientist, part Matrix Energetics wizard, I help people see and move in new ways. My public-speaking experiences include lectures at conferences such as the CT Alzheimer's Assoc, Verona Defeat Autism Now, Michael Margolis' Reinvention Summit Showcase and the Transformational Author Tribe. <br>
<br>
My goal is to change the face of brain health (Parkinson's, fibromyalgia, even bigotry) and help people truly experience this incredible world.

    Meet Some Rising Stars in the Story World #story12, a review by Katharine Hansen.<br>
&quot;Who might we hear as presenters at the next Reinvention Summit? Who are the future thought leaders who have visions of stories spinning in their heads and are newly charged up by Reinvention Summit 2? They just might be the group profiled below, who had the opportunity to describe their nascent projects, as well as the kind of support they seek from the community, during a &#x201c;Showcase&#x201d; session at Reinvention Summit 2. You&#x2019;ll learn even more about the first two, Kimberly Burnham and Dorit Sasson, because they have committed themselves to my Story Practitioners Q&amp;A series. Both are also contributing authors to the forthcoming book, Pebbles in the Pond, Transforming the World One Person at a Time. Kimberly Burnham, PhD, &#x201c;The Nerve Whisperer,&#x201d; uses storytelling to reinvent brain health. She uses her own story of vision recovery and the stories of her clients to inspire hope in people with genetic and neurological disorders, like Parkinson&#x2019;s (her PhD dissertation focused on the use of Alternative medicine to resolve symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s), macular degeneration (the most common cause of blindness in people over 60), Huntington&#x2019;s, and fibromyalgia/chronic pain. Kimberly needs a bigger platform so she can reach more people with her story and motivate them to search for and find solutions for themselves. &#x201c;Eyes can heal,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Genetic conditions can improve. Choose carefully who you listen to. Be conscious of what you tell yourself and others about your health and your future.&#x201d; Kimberly has much more to share, but I will save most of it for my Q&amp;A with her. In the meantime, you can understand more of where she&#x2019;s coming from by reading her remarkable story of vision recovery and healing from migraines.

Blue Morphos Butterflies in the Colombian Jungle<br>
I am Kimberly Burnham. When I was eight years old, my father helped me catch a blue morpho butterfly. Its huge, iridescent wings were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. A few years later I was photographing lions in Ngorongoro crater in Kenya. Then a great horned owl in Shinjuku park in downtown Tokyo. By the time I was 28, I was working as a professional photographer and journalist. And then&#x2026;&#x2026;I found myself in an ophthalmologist&#x2019;s office with a diagnosis of  a serious eye disorder, considering my life if I went blind. He said, &#x201c;It is genetic, so there is nothing you can do.&#x201d; For a time, I believed the doctor. Life is about moments of impact and who you choose to believe.......<br>

<p class=" description past-position">
    In Bo Eason's Personal Story Event I had a chance to write a list of 10 cool things about myself. Here is my revised, expanded and updated list:<br>
<br>
10. I sleep restfully with my girlfriend under a quilt I made with my grandmother, who learned quilting from her grandmother, an American pioneer who crossed the plains a hundred years before I studied at Brigham Young University (BYU), served a mission in Japan, and then became a lesbian.<br>
<br>
9. Bright red spinach-like leaves, I grow organic gluten-free amaranth in my Connecticut garden along with lemon cucumber, Asian pears and pink and white beets. My photographs have appeared on the cover of Onion World, Canadian Greenhouse Grower, The Produce News, all the news that is fresh and more.<br>
<br>
8. Japanese is my fourth language along with English, Spanish, and French. I learned Japanese in the Mormon missionary training center. People laugh when I speak German because my Friends in Munich are teaching me Bavarian slang. <br>
<br>
7. The air coming through my mask mimics the oxygen levels at the top of a mountain, then a few minutes later the air is more highly oxygenated than at sea level. The oxygen levels continue to cycle for 25 minutes as I think about the air I have breathed in my life: the polluted air of downtown Tokyo; the thin air at 12,000 feet near the shores of Lake Titicaca at the Peruvian stargate Amarumuru high above Machu Picchu; the warm salty Israeli air at the Dead Sea, the monsoon air in Bogota, Colombia...this air, today's air it goes in easily, filling my lungs and every cell in my body with life.<br>
<br>
Each story a part of my life&#x2019;s experiences, a part of what makes me - ME.<br>
<br>
I am combining Bo Eason's Personal Story Power Pack with &#x201c;World&#x2019;s Greatest Speaker Training,&#x201d; lead by Brendon Burchard, expert business leader extraordinare &amp; world famous vocal coach, Roger Love &amp; Bo.<br>

    Facing the man across from me, I have 3 minutes to tell my story. Moving down the line with 2 minutes for my story of vision recovery and migraine relief, I talked faster trying to get in more words. Moving again. 30 sec. I realized I have to choose the feels with the most impact. I look at each story in the 300 pages I wrote in preparation to be here. If I knew, I only had 30 sec to have a positive impact, what story would I tell. What offering of myself will have the greatest impact?<br>
<br>
The warm up exercises with Jean-Louis Rodrigue, a powerful movement coach &amp; Alexander Technique practitioner allows more awareness of my body and ability to fill space whether I am speaking in a small classroom or huge theater.<br>
<br>
Simon Mainwaring, founder of We First, a social branding consulting firm helps with image in light of a changing world.<br>
<br>
Comedian, Kyle Cease teaches Kylego, the art of speaking about what you want as if it has already happened (ie) Remember the turning point in Dec 2012 when we all became more open and appreciative of our ability to heal and live consciously in the moment.<br>
<br>
Los Angeles Psychologist, Joan Rosenberg, shares ways to develop core strength and integrate mind, body &amp; spirit through Emotional Pilates, the title of her upcoming book.<br>
<br>
A woman speaks her powerful story, eliciting a standing ovation Day 3 in the Thousand Oaks theater. Bo Eason asks, Do you know why you are standing and clapping? It is not for her. It is for yourselves. It is for the way you feel when she shares her story.<br>
<br>
It is a good feeling, one of many during the class as I listen to the powerful, poignant, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny stories of lives. What if I approach every person, every client, every student, every stranger I encounter with the thought, what can I say in 30 sec that will change life, give them a feeling they enjoy, that heals and helps them contribute more and be better people. And then I hope I never only have 30 seconds.

    6.  As a child, I lived in Brussels during the Vietnam war. I learned that a Gringo, an Ugly American are bad words before I really even knew what it was to be an American. Today I am grateful for my American and Canadian citizenship and for my life as a Third Culture Kid or Global Nomad.<br>
<br>
5. One September morning I swan through a patch of sea grass into a pride of lion fish, little terrorists of the Red Sea. I have swum with sharks in Hawaii, barracudas in the Florida, manta rays in Mexico, stone fish in Okinawa and dolphins in the Atlantic. A week later I was in Tel Aviv, learning how to keep myself safe as I watched as the Twin Towers burned.<br>
<br>
4. I authored the book, Our Fractal Nature, a Journey of Self-Journey and Connection. Just looking at natural fractals helps you recover faster after surgery. I joined Jack Canfield, Marci Shimoff, Janet Attwood, Marcelle Charrois and thought leaders in the book, Pearls of Wisdom: 30 Inspirational Ideas to Live Your Best Life Now with my chapter Fractals: Seeing the Patterns in Our Existence.<br>
<br>
3. My story of vision recovery is in: The Eyes Observing Your World, a chapter in Pebbles in the Pond: Transforming the World One Person at a Time and my upcoming book, The Nerve Whisperer.<br>
<br>
2. At 28, I was told I might go blind from genetic and autoimmune diseases of my eyes. In my journey since then, I became a massage therapist, headed the Vision Services department for The Center for Integrative Manual Therapy and Diagnostics, a large multidisciplinary clinic and completed a PhD in Integrative Medicine: The Effect of Integrative Manual Therapy on the Symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Today I have better vision than when I was 40 &amp; better than when I was diagnosed with Keratoconus, nystagmus and migraines.<br>
<br>
1. 8 yrs old, in a Colombian jungle my father helped me catch a blue morphos butterfly. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.<br>
<br>
Each story a part of my life&#x2019;s experiences, a part of what makes me - ME.

    I recently wrote a story for the Jacksonville, Florida Times-Union Newspaper contest. Here it is #282 or View gallery Kimberly Burnham Snow in the Universe's Plan at http://contests.jacksonville.com/engine/Details.aspx?p=A&amp;c=42460&amp;s=12001622&amp;i=1#SD<br>
<br>
Required elements of the story contest were Christmas Eve at an airport, train station or bus station. It is a fictional story but the wonderful way in which my life works makes it possibly true on any given holiday or day for that matter. Enjoy, Kim<br>

	&#x201c;I think there is a reason, we met. A powerful reason that will change both of our lives.&#x201d; <br>
	I look up from my book at a woman in her sixties with a bright red scarf. She is sitting next to me in a plastic airport seat, which is bolted to the ground, as if someone might run off with it on this stormy Christmas Eve.<br>
	&#x201c;What do you think the reason is?&#x201d; I ask, tired and not really wanting to engage.<br>
	&#x201c;Well, wouldn&#x2019;t you rather be at home with your family?&#x201d; her voice high-pitched and a little whiney.<br>
	&#x201c;Of course!  That is where I am trying to go ......................................

    Global Travelers: Try your geography skill: Virtual Pilot Lufthansa to Europe Destination Game. http://www.lufthansa-vp.com/vp1/play.html I have seen Istambul, Munich, Nice, Paris, Milan, Verona, Stockholm, Barcelona ..Still it is challenging.<br>
<br>
Have you seen: The Last Air Bender? Airbenders are the most powerful group &amp; can bend or manipulate earth, water and fire. I have been doing interval training,  hyperbaric oxygen w/ air, oxygen. Bending air, shifting energy so it flows easily into my cells, into my mitochondria, feeding the Kreb cycle, fueling my energy level. <br>
<br>
Recently in Munich, Germany after a long flight on Lufthansa/United Airlines, the air coming through my mask mimics a mountain tops' oxygen levels, then a few min later air more highly oxygenated than at sea level. Oxygen levels continue to cycle for 25 min as I think about the air I have breathed: the polluted air downtown Tokyo; thin air at 12,000 feet near the shores of Lake Titicaca at Peruvian stargate Amarumuru high above Machu Picchu; warm salty Israeli air Dead Sea, monsoon air in Bogota,Colombia; night air of Eifel Tower; dry air of Utah's desert; claustrophobic air in hyperbaric oxygen chambers, treatment for bronchitis, sucking in air at first sight of lions on a photographic trip in Africa Ngorongoro crater in Kenya; the Qigong breath I take at Karst mountains,China; the smoky Siberian train air ..this air, today's air it goes in easily, filling my lungs and every cell in my body with life, fueling the mitochondria in my heart.<br>
<br>
One of the main causes of claustrophobia, fear of flying, stress, anxiety, fibromyalgia, bronchitis is compromised lung capacity. It can all change. I spent months of my life sleeping sitting up because I would cough up phlegm and sometimes blood when I laid flat during a bronchitis attack.<br>
<br>
Today I have healed my bronchitis and enjoy every breath I take, even when I am flying around the world on United Airlines, Lufthansa,or my favorite airline - Southwest Air.

    Hey, I just submitted a 150 word story to Reader's Digest. Please check it out. A Gringo on the Colombian Wall   http://apps.facebook.com/yourlifecontest/content/gringo-colombian-wall-0 <br>
If I get enough votes for my submission I will be published in Reader&#x2019;s Digest. I would love your feedback and help.<br>

A Gringo on the Colombian Wall<br>
Kimberly Burnham<br>
 	I could see the street where the Colombian monsoon rains flooded down the hill carrying cardboard walls, socks, dirt and a torrent of personal items, ripped away from people who ..... read the rest on Reader&#x2019;s Digests Facebook page with the link above.<br>
<br>
In September, I came back from The Fulltime Messenger Program (Robert Evans and Susan Buckley, Bo Eason, Veronika Tracy-Smith and many more and Brendon Burchard&#x2019;s Expert&#x2019;s Academy. Bo Eason spoke at both events, performed his one man show Runt of the Litter, which is awesome, at Expert&#x2019;s Academy. After my connection with Bo Eason, his priority to encourage everyone to tell their story and Cynthia Kersey with The Unstoppable Foundation and her plan to educate every child in the world, I wrote this story about my experience as a child living with my family in Bogota, Colombia where my father was working for Ernst &amp; Ernst, an accounting firm.

    I use Matrix Energetics while coaching people so they can enjoy a greater level of health and quality of life. If you were my client this is one of the secrets I would share with you. You can improve your energy and level of health by doing this yourself.  <br>
	Look around the room, notice the colors, shapes, temperature, how you feel in the room. Then notice you hands, how they feel, the warmth, the texture of the skin. Now focus on your body and the area around your body. What two places draw your attention? These can be places that you want more comfort or function but can be anywhere. Place a hand on each of the interesting places. Now feel how you hand changes and what you notice about the places you have put your hands. Does each hand feel the same or are they different in terms of temperature, texture, energy? What do you feel? How does the texture of your clothing or skin feel? Is there any air between your hand and your body? Do you notice any pulsing rhythms or movement inside? Notice as much detail as you can about the places &amp; your hands.<br>
	Now keeping your hands on the 2 points draw your attention to a small thing in the room. Describe in detail that item, out loud to me or if you do this exercise as self-care to yourself or someone else. What shape, color or design does it have? It you were to tap on it what would it sound like? What size is it? Does it have a smell or a taste? Details, details tell me all the details. <br>
	Now draw your attention back to your hands. What has changed? Has what you notice about the two places changed? Has the texture, temperature, movement or rhythm changed? <br>
	What has changed about your feeling in and about the room or space you are in. Is the room brighter? Warmer? Cooler? Noisier? Notice the differences since you paid attention to the feelings at the beginning of the session.<br>
	Now move. How is your movement different? Is it more comfortable? More fluid? More energetic &amp; vibrant?<br>
	How have you benefitted?

    I help people with insomnia (sleep issues), fibromyalgia (chronic pain and sleep issues) and vision issues get more restorative sleep, move more comfortably and see the world in a more conscious way. If you want to wake up more productive, have more energy during your day and sleep more soundly, listen to the replay of my interview.<br>
Through a connection on Linkedin and Robert Evans at the Messengers of Change, Full-Time Messenger Program, my mini-book, Our Fractal Nature, a Journey of Self-Discovery and Connection I met Krystalya Marie at www.SQR.fm and she asked to interview me on Energy Healing for Body, Mind and Spirit, with Krystalya Marie. It was great fun and we had lots of people call in with questions on Wed September 14th at 9 pm EST. The replay is available at http://lnkd.in/zzhvJV   <br>
<br>
I shared quick and easy ways to increase your energy levels, sleep great tonight and ways to be more focused and productive and heal your nervous system. Please contact me for an interview or consultations.

    Brendon Burchard has been teaching me for almost a year, with Experts Academy, Total Product Blueprint, Promotional Partnership Seminar, Marketing Mastery and now I am stepping up for more training with World&#x2019;s Greatest Speaker Training, which Brendon Burchard does with Bo Eason and Roger Love.<br>
	Write about a poignant experience in your life, say Bo Eason, do it messy, in 7 minutes, just let the story out. Bo Eason&#x2019;s performance is riveting, whether he is speaking, teaching, casually answering questions or performing his semi-autobiographical award winning one man show, &#x201c;Runt of the Litter.&#x201d; His power and promise is what has drawn me to combine, World&#x2019;s Greatest Speaker Training with the Personal Story Powerpack live event. &#x201c;Write the Ten Coolest Things about Yourself&#x201d;, Bo said, the day I met him at the Robert Evan's Full-Time Messenger Program. <br>
	Maybe it is not related but the day after I stepped up for World&#x2019;s Greatest Speaker Training  one of my stories was accepted for  &quot;Pearls of Wisdom: 30 Inspirational Ideas to Live Your Best Life Now&quot;--an anthology of inspiration with Jack Canfield, Barnett Bain and other significant authors. Book to be released by Hampton Roads Publishing in Spring 2012.<br>
	My story a different part of it will also be in &quot;Pebbles in the Pond: Transforming the World One Person at a Time&quot; with New York Times Best-Selling Authors Marci Shimoff, Robert Allen and Sonia Choquette, as well as other transformational authors including, Christine Kloser, Simran Sofia Love, Sandra Longmore  Book to be released in the Spring 2012.<br>
 	I sometimes describe myself as an introvert, and yes I really, really am, in an extremely extroverted job. My hope in these two training programs is that I will face my fears, stretch my introvert and find that by doing what is so outside my comfort zone that every other stage, speech, or presentation with feel as comfortable as a casual conversation with friends<br>
	Thanks for sharing your stories and caring about mine.

    I don&#x2019;t get crazy walking into a library. I look for the book I want, sometime I will browse the audio book section or the movies, but I don&#x2019;t  get crazy looking at all the books and thinking I don&#x2019;t have time to read all of them. I am happy we have a great public library in West Hartford, CT.<br>
	I am changing my mindset on email newsletters and online training but right now I somehow have this mindset that I have to open and read the newsletter because it arrived in my inbox or I have to click the link and watch the video because someone sent it to me.<br>
	A voracious learned, widely read and educated, I am tempted by every newsletter and video  and at the same time frustrated and overwhelmed that I get so many offers of free and paid training that I could study 24 / 7 and still not learn everything.<br>
	Why don&#x2019;t I just treat my inbox like the public library? When I need the information in the future, it is actually more and more likely that it will be just a Google search away. The knowledge will be out there, in the world along with my books, Our Fractal Nature, a Journey of Self-Discovery and Connection; The Nerve Whisperer, Recover Your Life Through Brain Health, The Burnham Review, Sleep Better Tonight; and Parkinson&#x2019;s Solutions.<br>
	My hope is that when you need the knowledge I have to share you will go to the library, go to the bookstore or go online and read my books, share in my knowledge and live a happiest, healthier life<br>

    There is a saying that the way to tell the difference between a flower and a weed is by pulling gently on the base of the plant near the dirt. If it comes out easily it is a flow, if you have to yank it out it is a weed. By this definition Amaranth is a weed and very easy to grow. It comes up and spreads year after year in my West Hartford, CT garden. It grows along side, the nashi (Japanese Pears), lemon cucumbers and the usual beets, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, peas and carrots.<br>
	Amaranth is a beautiful tall red plant, almost as big as the sunflowers growing in my garden. I rarely harvest the seeds, rich in protein, gluten-free because they are tiny and very labor intensive. The leaves when small, early in the summer are great in salads, colorful, nutritious. Later when the leaves are larger they can be cooked and eaten like spinach.<br>
	I am gluten-free. Nothing really bad happens if I eat something with wheat, barley or rye but I feel better, I have more energy, and more brain clarity, if I keep a gluten free diet, so I do.<br>
	Earlier this year, I enjoyed lots of Peruvian quinoa soup, while visiting Machu Pichu, Amaru Muru, Cuzco, Wilka Tikka Chakra Gardens and other sacred sites with Pierre Garreaud, a Peruvian Shaman living in New Hampshire. There is something so nourishing about hot soup, filled with vegetables, protein rich seeds, consumed in the evening after hiking at 12,000 feet, feeling the vibration of the land and connecting with Mother Earth.<br>
	Growing Amaranth in my garden brings all those feelings rushing back, when I see the bright red Amaranth, the soft velvety tip with all the tiny white and black seeds.<br>
Please join me the weekend of October 28-30, 2011, for a workshop with Peruvian Shaman Pierre Garreaud. http://www.soundlighthealer.com/Calendar_Autumn2011.html<br>
It promises to be a profound &amp; deeply transformative weekend of connecting with deep dimensions of ourselves, each other and Pachamama (mother earth) for the purpose of healing.

<p class=" description past-position">
    A large gob of spit runs down my shirt. I am a twelve year-old American living in Brussels, Belgium in the late 1960's. Far away, the Vietnam war rages. My countrymen are fighting. I have lived less than half my life in the United States, I barely know what it means to be an American. Yet, someone has spit on my because of where I was born.<br>
<br>
Politics are a funny thing, really. Often the spit and dirt doesn't land right on the people responsible. It hits the ones that are handy, who are easy targets.<br>
<br>
Forty years later, I still have only lived a little over half my life in the United States and now in the very liberal state of Connecticut<br>
<br>
My staunch Republican, father sometimes walks around his house in Provo, UT, shaking his head saying, &quot;How did I raise Democrats?&quot;<br>
<br>
We don't talk politics much in my family, with my brother and I to the left of center and my parents and other siblings to the right. We enjoy each other and laugh, go to the beach, to movies and share meals with each other. We love each other and respect, each of our rights to love and live in the way that works best for us.<br>
<br>
I don't know about Mitt Romney's ancestors, but my Mormon ancestors five generations or more back gave up living and loving the way they wanted, in order to become American. In 1890, when Utah was granted statehood, my polygamist ancestors, had choices to make about obey the laws of the land or continuing to live and love the way they wanted to.<br>
I am an American, because they left polygamy behind. <br>
I voted for Barack Obama, and will do so again because I believe in reaching out a helping hand and in equal rights for all people regardless of who they love and how they want to make a family.<br>
<br>
I think it is wrong for someone like Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum to promise, if elected, to take away my rights to love and live the way I want with my girlfriend, in a committed relationship.<br>
<br>
I am happy Paul Ryan is the vice presidential candidate because I believe in American sanity.

    Shamanistic Training and Ceremonies in the Peruvian Andes with Pierre Garreaud<br>
	Laying on the cool lush, green grass above 7,000 feet at the bottom of a ring of stone circles, I let go of the old seeds in my life, opening to the new seeds in this ancient agricultural center.  Eleven of us have climbed into this sacred place, the rainy season just ending in the Peruvian Andes to start a journey of self-discovery and connection. Two weeks are filled with Chakra Unwinding Meditations; Shaman lead Despatchos ceremonies to Pachamama Mother Earth, the Apus (Mountains) and Lake Titicaca. Training, I am to be a Light Travelers, learning Ayni (Quechua for reciprocity and respect for the earth - Pachamama and the Chakana), participating in Shamanistic Ceremonies lead by remarkable, open hearted shamans including, Pierre Garreaud, Vilma Pinedo, Wilson Pinedo, Don Martin, Don Ricardo, Don Fernando and Don Benito.<br>
	Ten of us plus our shaman guides, profoundly changed in our gifts as healers, seers, clairvoyants and light and sound workers opening our chakras as we tuned in to the strong energy vortexes the Andes are known for. The highlights: Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders, the Temple of the Moon at Huayna Picchu and eating quinoa soup at the Willka T'ika Chakra Gardens in the Sacred Valley near Cusco. <br>
	My Learning:<br>
	Ayni and giving back to the earth and the environment is a privilege, our responsibility, and an opportunity to improve our lives and the lives of everyone we come in contact with.<br>
	Some of the kindest most open hearted people in the world live in Peru in South America.<br>
	In the sacred places in the Peruvian Andes, the mountains and stones, vibrate with an energy that is healing, haunting and calming.<br>
	It is possible each day to see new things and to see old things in a new way.<br>
	Connecting with nature is healing and healthy.<br>
	I have so much to be grateful for.<br>
	My thanks to Pierre Garreaud, a wonderful leader, potent shaman and a kind soul.

<p class=" description past-position">
    Traveling home. My last day in Peru, started at 5 am in Puno, Peru on the shores of Lake Titicaca at 12,000 above sea level.  Our shaman guide, Bruno from Puno, my girlfriend, Vicki and I walked across the red rock fill agricultural land. A pilgrimage, balancing on the ridges of smooth serpent shaped rocks, hiking along the edges of potato and quinoa fields. Birds and butterflies drawing our attention. <br>
	After about an hour, we saw the star gate Amarumuru for the first time. The Peruvian boy selling carver tablets depicting the stories of this place dwarfed by the huge carved rock. Later we would pay the man at the front gate collecting a few Peruvian soles from the occasional tourist. We had come in the back way like pilgrims, preparing for the sight in contemplation.<br>
	Meet by a trio of Andrean ibises the calling to us, scolding us for disturbing the peace of the place before I spoke to them. They fly off as if satisfied that we did belong here in this sacred place, where hundreds of years ago an Inca priest is said to have protected sacred treasures from the marauding conquistadores by walked into the rock face. No, not in amongst the rocks but into the rock face and up to the Pleiades, that star system sacred to the Incas.<br>
	In a tube like opening cut in the stone, stretching up to the sky, I stood quietly one hand over my heart chakra the other over my solar plexus feeling my heart beat, my breathing, the energy of the place, remembering the third eye stone at Machu Pichu, the climb to the temple of the moon on the back side of Huayna Picchu, my Tibetan Buddhist training near Glastonbury England,, the coolness of the stones at Stonehenge, the red rock of Lake Powell, Sinai at the Red Sea all my sacred places. I didn't hear a voice, or see a vision but in that moment I knew that I was at home in my body. I know, I am okay. Not, I am going to be okay. Just I am okay and will continue to enjoy life with a passion because I am okay just the way I am.

    Studying Shamanism and Changing the World with Sandra Ingerman (Feb 2011)<br>
	In her 2010 Sounds True Insights at the Edge, Sandra Ingerman, Shamanism and Spiritual Light explained how, &#x201c;shamanism teaches us that there's a web of life that connects us all and that classic shamanism, is that our outer world is a reflection of our inner state of consciousness.&#x201d; She notes, &#x201c;One of the great teachings from shamanism is that if you really want to change the world that you live in, to move your focus inward because we're actually dreaming the &quot;outer world by the invisible world of substance that we're building within us. Then through shamanism, [they] teach the person about the changes that they need to make in their life to live from a place of passion and meaning, and to move back into a place of living life from a place of appreciation, gratitude, honor, and respect, and connecting with nature and life itself in order to restore long-term healing and not short-term healing. <br>
	My book Our Fractal Nature, a Journey of Self-Discovery and Connection is in a way Shamanism meet Quantum Physics. Our Fractal Nature gives you a way to reconnect to your inner being, your physical body, to the trees, water and nature around you.

  My favorite Matrix Energetics quote: &quot;Change now, while you still can. Change now because you can, change now because it is the right thing to do. Change now because there is no right, no left, no time left, no space left. Only you. Change.&quot; &#x2013; Dr. Richard Bartlett, DC, ND Consciousness Healing Radio Interview June 20, 2007 achieveradio.com<br>
  I lead a study group in West Hartford, CT; and work in Connecticut, San Diego, CA; Munich, Germany, Eugene, Oregon &amp; at a distance (phone consultations). I have free weekly session on Facebook at Kimberly Burnham, The Nerve Whisperer. <br>
  Matrix Energetics certified practice incorporating a variety of knowledge and skills. I started studying Matrix Energetics, the Transformational work of Richard Bartlett, Justice Bartlett and Melissa Joy several years ago and am now a certified practitioner as well as a certified study group leader. <br>
  Practitioners certification occurs with repeating Level 1 and 2 and completing the case study experiences and practitioner training with Richard Bartlett. Matrix Energetics is a form of information Medicine, based on Quantum Physics, Scalar waves of possibility &amp; particles of experience, Physicist Fred Alan Wolfe's work.Matrix Energetics taps into the morphic field of infinite potential &amp; provides easy access to infinite possibilities.  <br>
  Levels 1 &amp; 2: how to access the field of the heart, expand beyond limiting belief systems, and get out of your own way by tapping into the powerful morphic fields, a concept developed by Rupert Sheldrake.

<p class=" description past-position">
    A certified Integrative Manual Therapy (IMT) practitioner, I spent 10 plus years at the Center for Integrative Manual Therapy and Diagnostics and Desert Light Health Associates, treating clients in Bloomfield, CT and as the clinical manager in Boulder, Colorado.  My job titles included, instructor at the Connecticut School of Integrative Manual Therapy; Director of Knowledge Management and Clinical Information Services, Neurodegenerative Disorders, and VisionIMT.<br>
<br>
The thing I love most about the 11 years working for Sharon Weiselfish Giammatteo at the Center for Integrative Manual Therapy and Diagnostics (now the Institute of Integrative Manual Therapy) is the opportunity to see positive changes in clients with a dismal medical forecast. I have the good fortune to see so many positive changes, changes that many would consider miraculous or impossible. This experience has ignited my ability to see that anything is possible.<br>
<br>
I consulted with clients in Hong Kong, Israel and Italy, as well as treating people from all over the world in Bloomfield, CT, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Boullder, Colorado. One highlight was speaking at the &quot;Defeat Autism Now&quot; 2007 conference in Verona, Italy. In 2008, I spoke about &quot;Using Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine for Alzheimer's Disease&quot; at the CT Alzheimer's Association meetings.

<p class=" description past-position">
    In my 20's, I was diagnosed with Keratoconus, a genetic condition of the eye where the cornea thins. Today, at 53, I have better vision than when I turned 40, probably better vision than when I was 12 and started wearing glasses.<br>
	For about 10 yrs thru my 40's &amp; early 50's, I was Clinical Director of VisionIMT at the Center for Integrative Manual Therapy &amp; Diagnostics, a large multi-disciplinary clinic in Bloomfield, CT. I often said, &quot;I am director of vision services because no one can tell me it doesn't work.&quot;<br>
	Light sensitivity is one of the typical symptoms of Keratoconus. Today, my friends often reach for their sunglasses before I even think about where mine are. I also had severe migraines five or six times a year, weather related. I have had one in the last 10 years.<br>
	My journey to better eye health began not where, perhaps it should have when I was diagnosed with Keratoconus but much later in my forties when after a hour of Integrative Manual Therapy focused on my eyes. I put on my glasses and literally felt like I had put on someone else's glasses my vision was so different.<br>
	In that moment, I knew my vision could improve and set about creating that reality for myself, my friends, family and clients.<br>
	To create healing for myself as well as healing and recovery for my clients, I use a combination of hands-on therapies.<br>

    The force of the accident, still there in Joanne's face, as I gently rested my hands over her eyelids. I feel the vibration - the energy - the crunch of the cold metal bumper as the car slid through the red light into the crosswalk, slamming into the stroller shattering her facial bones. Keeping the overwhelm at bay, I tell myself, I am here to help this three-year-old heal.<br>
	&quot;I don't know how you're going to do it,&quot; my boss, the creative and clinical force behind a large complementary-medicine clinic, draws my attention away from the sleeping child, &quot;but your job is to fix up the bone bruises in the back of the orbit of her eyes.&quot; <br>
	This monumental task becomes a catalyst. It affects me personally, as a human being desiring the love and respect of others and wanting to contribute to health and peace in the world. Professionally, it challenges me as an Integrative Manual Therapist to develop my hands-on skills for people with brain issues. <br>
	Within healthcare, alternative medicine practitioners are often told what isn't possible. And yet I have been privileged to see miracles occur on a regular basis, as in this case, when the child regained her sight and the damage to her face healed.. <br>
	For about 10 yrs thru my 40's &amp; early 50's, I was Clinical Director of VisionIMT at the Center for Integrative Manual Therapy &amp; Diagnostics, a large multi-disciplinary clinic in Bloomfield, CT. I often said, &#x201c;I am director of vision services because no one can tell me it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;<br>

    I moved my head from side to side as slowly and quietly as I could. I had to finish the mid-term exam and I couldn&#x2019;t read the paper. 2 hrs earlier I was telling myself, &quot;You shouldn't have skipped lunch but this isn't a migraine. This is just missing lunch.&quot; Have you ever had that, where you know it is a migraine but it is not severe enough for you to believe that it is.<br>
Now there was a big black hole in the middle of my vision. Finishing the test, I took a taxi home and laid down in a dark quiet room, gently pressing on the back of my neck, thinking, &quot;Enough! I have to find a solution to the migraines. Five or six severe migraines a year for ten years is too long.&quot;<br>
About finished with massage school at Sutherland-Chan, I started taking CranioSacral Therapy and SomatoEmotional Release classes at the Upledger Institute; Cranial Therapy from the Milne Institute, plus Cranial Osteopathy classes in the Canadian College of Osteopathy's five year program. I studied with Harold I.Magoun, Jr. His father is famous for his book Osteopathy in the Cranial Field.<br>
I studied other things too like, Lymphatic Drainage  from French Osteopath, Philippe Druelle, DO; Process Acupressure; Paul Chauffer's Mechanical Link and Visceral Manipulation with Jean-Pierre Barral, Frank Lowen and then 100's hrs of Integrative Manual Therapy classes with Sharon W. Giammatteo, Tom Giammatteo, Kris Albrecht, Nancy Ortolani, Kris Godiksen, &amp; other wonderful instructors.<br>
	One year, 1999, I literally spent 100 plus days in class, but the studying, training, self-treatment, treatment exchanges with friends, has totally been worth it, because in the last 12 years, I have had one migraine, during a stressful time with the exact weather pattern trigger, a bright sunny, sunny day followed by a thunder and lighting storm. <br>
	And that one, was three years ago so I have invested 1000's of hrs of training, tuition dollars &amp; treatment costs but ....... migraine-free &#x2013; priceless.

    Tibetain Shamanism Training Healing Voice with Jill Purce in Glastonbury, England (May, 2008)<br>
	<br>
	I will quit my job when I return. It was the first time I said aloud what I had been thinking for a year. Here introducing myself to 70 strangers, I recommitted to my own happiness, to work that is satisfying, enjoyable and contribute to healing the world, one person at a time.<br>
	I didn&#x2019;t expect my life to change so dramatically in a week but these seven days in a British Retreat Center near Glastonbury, the mystical mythical center of the English speaking world drew out of me the power that had been crushed for a few years. These seven days filled with potent shamanism, Tibetan Green Tara chanting, moving meditations, the opening of powerful hearts and minds. Life altering symbolism incorporated into expression and observation of the past, present and imagining the future as well as the symbolism of the death of the old and rebirth of pure joy.<br>
	These seven days sandwiched in my life between two other powerful sound healing expediencies with Jill Purce at Naropa Institute (the Buddhist University) in Boulder Colorado and at Esalen Institute near Big Sur, California. <br>
	My Learning:<br>
	I am powerful when I hold the vibration of my soul with an open hand, reaching out to the life experiences that nourish me and help me share my unique skills to improve the quality of the lives around me.<br>
	The answer to the question, &#x201c;What do I want? and What can I share? is powerful.<br>
	Thank you Jill Purce for helping me to change my life.

    Everyone know that if you want to avoid Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease you should do crossword puzzles, learn a new language after the age 50, or sing new songs in a choir. In this context what is a cross word puzzle? It is a form of information that you take in in a way that demands something of your brain and nervous system, asking your brain to lay down new pathways, in a way that has a healing effect on the whole nervous system.<br>
	A crossword puzzle is a form of information medicine. <br>
	You may be familiar with homeopathy, with arnica, or Traumeel or rescue remedy, a Bach Flower remedy. These are all form of information medicine, in which information, in this case information conveyed in a liquid or table form, is used in a therapeutic way.<br>
	Matrix Energetics is another form of information medicine, which is conveyed through words, touch or intention energy. The two point technique, which is the corner stone of Matrix Energetics is about putting each hand on a place, on the body or not, and noticing the interaction between the two places, noticing how the person changes, noticing how their relationship with their environment changes. In information as in quantum physics, the observer matters and what the practitioner, client, anyone interacting or included are assessing, measuring, noticing, or seeing changes things because it changes the information that is available to the person&#x2019;s mind, to their bones, to their kidneys, to their world.<br>
	The courses are taught all over the world, including US, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan. There are classes in Europe www.MatrixEnergetics.com Salzburg, Austria; Luzern, Switzerland; Frankfurt, Germany. In the US  Ft Lauderdale, FL; Seattle, WA; San Francisco, CA; Asheville, NC; Albuquerque, NM; Scottsdale, Arizona; Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California; &amp; ....For more info on Level 1 &amp; 2; Registeration; Seminar Description; Hotel Info; Events; and Pricing contact Richard Bartlett and Melissa Joy @ www.MatrixEnergetics.com

    I was at Costco, the other day, buying Pelagrino. Ten cases and the cashier said &quot;Drinking all that I bet you learn French really well.&quot; What's up with that? Drinking Pelagrino, I am learning Italian, I already know French. <br>
	I have been studying Hebrew. I can say, Ani Mevina Kusat Evrite, the problem is I am so good at saying &quot;I understand a little Hebrew&quot; that people believe me. And of course learning Hebrew, going to Nevei Kodesh (Oasis of Holiness), some people might think I am Jewish. I not. I am known as an Observant Non-Jew <br>
	One of the things I love is Israeli food, although, I am not that fond of is the green olives. You see,  I ate a lifetime supply of green olives when I was 10. My family was traveling in Utah in red rock country. I wanted to make a layered colored sand piece in a little jar. It turns out green olive jars are perfect for that. I wanted to make several and my father didn't think just buying the green olives, throwing them out and using the bottles was such a great idea, so I ate a lifetime supply and not one since.<br>
	I love traveling, no I should say I love teaching working playing in different places, the actual traveling part is getting harder and harder. The other day I was at the Denver airport and the security line was so long that the guy in front of me said, &quot;As you get near the front of the line there is a sign that says you have to be this ---- high to get on this ride.&quot;<br>
	And the security people are they closely scrutinizing everyone or what. One time, I got pull aside for &quot;special&quot; screening, they went through all my bags, took my coat, wanded me, handed my coat back and said,  &quot;Have a nice flight, Sir.&quot;<br>
	I have been thinking of Hot Air Ballooning more, it is probably safer. Last Summer, Karen &amp; I went Hot Air Ballooning in Steamboat Springs. A beautiful day, It was awesome and my cell phone worked. I was all excited my first Hot Air Balloon ride, I called my parent...Got the answering machine...that is just plain wrong.

    &quot;Wow, you are a journalist, where might I have seen your writing?&quot; I laugh. I am at a party in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with friends and a woman asks me what I do. &#x201c;You probably haven&#x2019;t seen any of it. I write for agricultural trade publications. My readers are everyone in the food chain between the farmer and the consumer. I write for fresh fruit and vegetable packers, fruit distributors, flowershops, wholesale produce marketer.&#x201d; <br>
	I work for The Produce News, not many of my friends are in my target audience. Carol thinks the funniest magazine I write for is Onion World, but I am telling you it is high gloss and when I get a picture of award winning Ontario onions at The Royal Winter Fair on the cover it looks good.<br>
	My job as a freelance agriculture journalist is really an education. I learn about how  yellow, red and even purple specialty bell peppers get to the Chicago produce market then to the retailer while writing for 970 articles and photos (1986-1994) The Produce News, a weekly newspaper. I also know that the FedEx at the airport has the latest deadline, when, my copy and photos have to be in New Jersey.<br>
	I learn about Canadian apples, pears, even one greenhouse in BC that grows bananas while writing 15 articles for the Canadian Fruitgrower. I learn Toronto suburbs used to be covered with greenhouses growing tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers while writing 38 articles for Greenhouse Canada. I learn about an Ontario greenhouse heated with hot waste water from a neighboring nuclear powerplant. Twenty-four articles in Onion World teaches me more about onions than I ever knew there was to know. More learning as I freelance articles to Alive, Canadian Journal of Health &amp; Nutrition,  Seafood Leader, Canadian Aquaculture, Catering Today, Cognition Organic Farming, Gleanings in Beekeeping, The Grower, The Growing Edge (20 yrs later you can find my Growing Edge articles online), Mushroom Trade Report, Organic Gardening, Small Farmer's Journal &amp; Jewish Vegetarians.

    &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t really hear the difference between bat and vat, can you? You just know what they are saying by the context, right?&#x201d;said the 28 year old Japanese man. When we can&#x2019;t hear something we imagine no one else can either. <br>
&#x201c;No, I really can hear the difference,&#x201d; I said, using music, word games, and neurolingistic programing to teach English. I learned how much motivation varies and influences our ability to learn, during my 3 years I teaching in Japan. I work on Izu Peninsula with men from Taisei Construction so they could work in Saudi Arabia for a year at a time, away from their wives and families. I worked with Kikoman Soy Sauce Tokyo managers on their way to Singapore to set up a factory. I spent six months in remote Kamaishi, Iwate-Ken, teaching bright young graduates of Tokyo University on their first assignment for Shinitetsu/Japan Steel. <br>
Interac, an English teaching company, sent me, because I speak Japanese. Not that I needed it to teach but because there was only one other foreigner, a man from India married to a Japanese woman. My days filled with reading, four hours of teaching, hiking in the beautiful countryside, making origami dolls with the woman next door, talking to the occasional tourist, wandering through to see the 100 foot high, Deity Kuan Yin, holding a fish, facing the Pacific.<br>
It was a chance to turn inward, to connect with nature and to consider what it is to be an insider and an outsider and why we divide ourselves into groups.<br>
After a while the children in Kamaishi got to know me and stop yelling &#x201c;Gaijin, gaijin,&#x201d; every time I walked outsidee. &#x201c;Gaijin&#x201d;, doesn&#x2019;t only mean foreigner, it literally translates as &#x201c;outside person,&#x201d;.<br>
One time I brought a baby gift to a friend, at least I considered her a friend. A few weeks later I got a picture of me holding the baby, on the back she had written, &quot;Congratulations, you are the first foreigner to hold my baby.&#x201d;

    My father in his three piece suit jimmied the fireplace flue. It took me a few minutes to realize why the smoke was filling the room where my father's business associates mingled before dinner. I quietly went out to the backyard, maneuvered the heavy wood plank from where it sat balanced on a stone on a little bump in the grass. Eight years old, afraid that my parents would be angry and embarrassed by the smoke in the livingroom, that was my fault. <br>
	Quickly, I shimmed up the plank onto the top of the 10 foot brick wall surrounding our backyard. I walked along the walls, avoiding the bits that had broken glass.<br>
I climbed higher up onto our roof, from where I could see the barrio on the hill dark in the night. No time to think of the times children had shouted Gringo at me, where I learned that Gringo was a bad word before I even really knew what it was to be an American, to have access to as much education as I wanted, to have opportunities to study, travel, learn and become whatever I wanted. No time to think about monsoon season when water flooded down the hill into my street washing down personal items, ripped away from children, who so gladly took the bags of candy, food and clothing, I offered them last Christmas with my father, from whom I learned, there are too many people to just give out money, we can never fill that need. The way to really help is to choose a few people and pay for education. Like paying for books and school uniforms for Hector and Maria in the house down the street. I have never forgotten the value of education in lifting people out of poverty and I have never forgotten the sadness in not being able to help everyone, in having to choose. <br>
	But in this moment, I was headed across the roof where earlier in the day, playing, I found a lightweight piece of metal and without thinking had set it on top of the chimney.<br>
	Removing it, I snuck much the my father's relief the smoke was going up the chimney and out into the night.

    The brown and white dappled horse trotted back to the tan adobe house. Sitting on the back of the saddle behind my mean older cousin, my lips pursed, frustration welling up in my strong four-year old body. Willful though I was, the ground was too far away and I still too small to jump from my perch on the full sized horse. <br>
	Below me on the dry New Mexico field, a horned toad, four shades of brown, with yellow and a white strip down the back and around the scaly edges basked in the sun. I wanted to feel it puff up in my hands. I wanted to touch the cool scaly reptile, but my cousin wouldn&#x2019;t let me off the horse. Tempted as I was, I was too scared to jump, afraid I might breaking my leg. <br>
	Back at the house, safely lifted from the horse, I ran back out into the fields, searching fruitlessly for my horned toad, holding on to that sunny summer New Mexico day, filled with emotion and longing, my first clear memory.

<p class=" description past-position">
    Nearly a year old, a banana in my hand I walk. Then suddenly, realizing the trickery, I dropped abruptly to the wood floor, cushioned by my diapers. My parents, knew that I physically could walk but I lacked the confidence. It had been several months since I had first pulled myself up and walked around always holding something - always hanging on to a chair or the coffee table or my mother&#x2019;s hand. <br>
	They weren&#x2019;t sure about the best timing and the stories they tell of those time, whhhh. I have this image of myself several months old, fists closed around bars on my crib, bending them like a miniature Popeye and hopping out. The reality is my parents, first time parents, married a couple of years, had cut the legs off my crib, when I started crawling and pulling myself up, afraid I would climb out. They made it easy, narrowing the gap between the top of the rail and the floor, protecting me from my curious, adventurous spirit.<br>
	Walking independently had started with my father holding my hand walking with me around our small Los Angeles home. As soon as he slipped his hand from mine I would plop down on the floor, crawl over to a couch or a stool and pull myself up. So, they tricked me into exploring on my own two feet. <br>
	My father wrapped one tiny hand around a banana. He held tight to the other end. I walked happily knowing I was love, supported, and safe, until I realized I was the only one holding the banana. I was on my own walking as my parent&#x2019;s smiles burst out into the room.<br>
	Predictably, I plopped down, but that day somewhere inside of me I knew I could walk in the world with my friends and family around me AND confidently alone, feeling their support even in their absence. <br>
	Those tiny legs would carry me all across the United States, up the stairs into planes bound for Colombia, Belgium, Kenya, Japan, Canada, Israel, Germany eventually I would walk on every continent.

    Lowen Systems: Dynamic Manual Interface is a beautiful blend of both art and science. Developer, Frank Lowen was, in fact, an artist before pursuing his initial studies in the healing arts. His original thought was that he would combine his interest in alternative therapies with a means to support his career in fine arts. His artistic mind, intense motivation and curiosity of the human body enabled him to excel in many modalities, but two mentors clearly stood out in terms of their work and influence: Dr. John Upledger and Dr. Jean-Pierre Barral.

    Facing the man across from me, I have 3 min to tell my story. Moving down the line with 2 min for my story of vision recovery and migraine relief, I talked...faster trying to get in more words. Moving again. 30 sec. I realized I have to choose the feels with the most impact. I look at each story in the 300 pg I wrote in preparation to be here. If I knew, I only had 30 sec to have a positive impact, what offering of myself will have the greatest impact?<br>
 <br>
A woman speaks powerfully eliciting an ovation in the Thousand Oaks Theater. Bo Eason asks, Do you know why you are standing, clapping? It is not for her. It is for yourselves. It is for the way you feel when she shares her story.<br>
 <br>
It is a good feeling as I listen to powerful, poignant, sometimes tragic or funny stories. What if I approach every person, every client, student, or stranger I encounter with the thought, what can I say in 30 sec that will change life,<br>
 <br>
My story, more important than emotions. There are no victims here.

In many forms of complementary medicine, healing work, and quantum physics, there is a concept of surrogacy and mental time travel. The idea is, &#x201c;what happens to the one person, especially a family member (family of origin or chosen family) affects everyone and that YOU can intention yourself into a time and space where magical things happened or are happening and participate fully, like what happened in Maryland, March 2012 at Christine Kloser&#x2019;s Transformational Author&#x2019;s Retreat.<br>
A story from Starhawk: An army is marching to destroy. The town&#x2019;s people gather to choose how they will respond. Some say, let us mount an army &amp; fight. The group prevails by sends children out to meet the army. Each child greets a soldier, walks beside him as he marches to destroy their town. The child offers there is a place set for you at my table. [more] http://pebblesinthepondbook.com/blog/transformational-authors/join-me-as-a-partner-in-world-transformation/

Especially enjoyed hearing Jacqueline Novogratz, a remarkable story teller who uses her experiences with people around the world to share her vision for a global economy that includes all of us. The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust &#x201c;charity&#x201d; against those who mistrust reliance on the markets.  Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way: patient capital with promising stories of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.  http://tedxbyu.com/video  and www.TEDxBYU.com                  </p>

    This training is the start of a major move in the Messenger Network to focus efforts on helping more messengers shift into a bigger experience of their message. It helped me make my shift and showed me how to share my message with the world using the power and outreach of the Internet. There is always a whole other level to monetize that message and reach more people. This event helped me create a plan. It is time for messengers to activate more messengers. The path to manifesting a &quot;New Human Experience&quot; is through a collective energy and effort. The energy of a collective is more powerful than the energy of one.  I learned that every messenger I activate will increase my own attracting power and help me be more successful in your messenger business.  I learned how to &quot;Be The Source&quot; to other messengers and to expand that ripple of change I make in the world. It's a simple and wonderful way to leave a large personal legacy...............................................................

    How to Read the Akashic Records Training with Linda Howe, Founder and Director of the Center for Akashic Studies and author of How to Read the Akashic Records and Healing Through the Akashic Records. One of the class exercises was differentiating between intuition and exploring the Akashic Records. This exercise has been life-changing for me because what I found was that my intuition gave me a &#x201c;to do list&#x201d; for example, these are the five things to do to launch your book, where as once I said the Pathway Prayer Process the information was all about how to develop relationships in order to launch my book. I am going into the Records and asking, &#x201c;how can I best serve each of my clients today as I work with them?&#x201d; Each morning before I start work with my manual therapy or distance coaching and Matrix Energetics clients, I go into the Akashic Records and ask &#x201c;What from my tool box will best serve them, so they feel and function better?&#x201d;  I found this class very insight provoking.

    In Mar 2011 I attended Jeff Primack&#x2019;s Qi Revolution at qigong.com in West Hartford, CT. The four days included a great line up of activities from active movement to powerful relaxing . My favorite part was the Qigong walking which I do daily, whenever I am walking and the nine breath method of breathing which I have also been doing for a few minutes each day. Kai Van Bodegom-Smith leading the Supreme Science Qigong form was wonderful. Often I also drink a smoothie, which includes a raw beet which Jeff Primack recommends to oxygenate the blood and the body.<br>
	The Supreme Science Qi Revolution has gotten me back on track of practicing every day. Thank you Jeff and Kai for bring this to Hartford Connecticut.

    My ability to make videos and more importantly get my message out and hep people feel better, move and sleep better has been so impacted by Veronika Tracy-Smith. She is an awesome coach -- very caring and compassionate. As well she is so knowledgeable about the technical aspects of producing a video and that made it easy for me to understand her direction and coaching. I enjoyed my opportunity to get coach by Veronika at the Full-Time Messenger program and I appreciate our connection through Experts Academy, Brendon Burchard and Christian Pankhurst. Thanks you for sharing your skills and passion.

    This Health Coaching Training Program supported me in developing a practice enabling people to find the inner strength and external resources to shift, improve their lives and accomplish their goals. As a coach, I work with each individual client to co-create a new reality for people at various levels of stress or feeling disconnected from their physical body, self and others. I have great tools and have developed a strong skills set working with people with nervous system issues (such as Anxiety, Parkinson&#x2019;s, M.S., Alzheimer&#x2019;s), and vision problems (macular degeneration, glaucoma). Contact me if you want support or if you are feeling betrayed by your body, unsafe in the world, different from others or not included.

    In 1985, I spent a month in China traveling, watching and occasionally trying TaiChi and Qigong in the parks. For me the most beautiful place is Guilin, where Mingtong Gu leads Wisdom Healing Qigong trips. I hope to go sometime.<br>
	I started practicing Qigong a couple of years ago while working at Mission Hills Physical Therapy in San Diego with Ralph Havens, PT at MissionHillsPT.com. I spend about eight weeks a year working there and each week attend a Qigong evening lead by Federico Garcia-Anguiano qifieldtherapy.com<br>
	In 2009 I took at Wisdom Healing Qigong class from Mingtong Gu chicenter.com and took the 100 days challenge - to do the 22 minute Lift Chi Up &amp; Pour Chi Down Method (LCUPCD) every day for 100 days. After completing that which felt awesome, I now do Qigong 2 -3 times per week.
