The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) was established by a Royal Charter in 1880. It has over 130,000 members. Over 15,000 of these members live and work outside the UK. The Institute also has some 9,000 students.<br>
<br>
The Institute is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), formed in 1974 by the major accountancy professional bodies in the UK and Ireland. The fragmented nature of the accountancy profession in the UK is in part due to the absence of any legal requirement for an accountant to be a member of one of the many Institutes, as the term accountant does not have legal protection. However, a person must belong to the ICAEW, ICAS or ICAI to hold themselves out as a chartered accountant in the UK (although there are other chartered bodies of British qualified accountants).<br>
<br>
The ICAEW has two offices in the UK; the main one is in Moorgate, London &amp; the other in Central Milton Keynes, in the newly built Hub:MK complex. In 2009 it also opened regional offices in Singapore and Dubai to support its members in Asia, followed by Beijing in 2011.

&quot;Until the mid-nineteenth century the role of accountants in England &amp; Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers in that accountants merely maintained records of what other business people had purchased &amp; sold. However, with the growth of the limited liability company &amp; large scale manufacturing, &amp; logistic in Victorian Britain a demand was created for more technically proficient accountants to deal with the increasing complexity of accounting transactions, dealing with depreciation of assets, inventory valuation &amp; the Companies legislation being introduced. To improve their status &amp; combat criticism of low standards, accountants in the cities of Britain formed professional bodies. The ICAEW was formed from the 5 of these associations that existed in England prior to its establishment by Royal Charter in May 1880.<br>
<br>
The Incorporated Society of Liverpool Accountants, formed in January 1870; The Institute of Accountants in London was formed in November 1870, comprising 37 members under the leadership of William Quilter. In 1871, standards for membership were established with new members having to show knowledge &amp; aptitude through successfully passing an oral examination. Initially the London Institute restricted its membership to that city, but as other institutes were established elsewhere (for example, in Manchester and Sheffield) it was decided to remove this restriction and as such in 1872 it simply became known as the Institute of Accountants to reflect its new national coverage; The Manchester Institute of Accountants, formed in February 1871; The Society of Accountants in England (1872); The Sheffield Institute of Accountants (1877).....The Institute has 22 district societies, the largest of which is the London Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) with over 37,000 members. The LSCA has often taken the lead in making proposals for change..&quot;<br>

    I have been a practising arbitrator, more especially a practising accountant arbitrator, for a number of years.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
The majority of my appointments are either Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAEW) or Law Society (LS) arbitration appointments, with the occasional ad hoc arbitration appointment. The ICAEW tends to appoint me when the arbitration has a legal aspect and it is thought that 'just an accountant arbitrator' is inappropriate. The LS tends to appoint me when the arbitration has an accountancy aspect and it is thought that 'just a lawyer arbitrator' is inappropriate. In short my arbitration appointments are based upon my dual accountant lawyer qualification.<br>
<br>
My arbitration appointments range from the 'bread and butter' partnership dispute, through the profit share / joint venture disputes, lease calculations and so forth.<br>

    I have a consultancy with Taylor Vinters.<br>

    Beaumont &amp; Son merged with Clyde &amp; Co, but still maintained it's independent name within Clyde &amp; Co. According to the Clyde &amp; Co website:-<br>
<br>
&quot;Beaumont &amp; Son - Aviation at Clyde &amp; Co has been named global Aviation Law Firm of the Year 2006 in the Who's Who Legal Awards. This accolade follows similar recognition in the inaugural awards last year.<br>
<br>
Following on from the success of the 2005 awards, Who's Who Legal has used the thousands of nominations received from clients and private practice professionals in the course of an ongoing research process to identify the pre-eminent lawyer and firm in each of the 27 practice areas covered in The International Who's who of Business Lawyers 2006, published in March.<br>
<br>
Managing editor Callum Campbell said: 'Once again, we are delighted to recognise Beaumont &amp; Son - Aviation at Clyde &amp; Co with the Who's Who Legal; The International Who's Who of Business Lawyers Aviation Law Firm of the Year Award. This is the second year running that the firm has achieved this distinction, and the firm can boast outstanding individual talent across multiple jurisdictions. It can truly be said to be the world's leading firm for aviation expertise.'<br>
<br>
Eleven partners from the firm across four countries received sufficient nominations to be included in the aviation chapter of the publication, and John Balfour and Fernand Garnault feature among the most highly regarded individuals in the research overall.<br>
<br>
The awards are based on a number of factors, including the feedback received in the ongoing research process, past performance in the research and the overall aggregate number of weighted votes cast in their favour. The awards are announced in the The International Who's Who of Business Lawyers, and identify the pre-eminent lawyer and firm in each of the 27 practice areas covered by the Who's Who Legal series. For the first time this year, the awards also recognise the overall leading firm in 47 countries around the world.&quot;

<p class=" description past-position">
    Morison Stoneham (MS) was a 'top 30 accountancy practice', the founder member of Morison International, the major network of independent accountants and the first UK accountancy practice to float. I was an MS partner and the head of MS insolvency.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
According to an Accountancy Age report on the float:<br>
<br>
&quot;The deal valued the firm at... &#xa3;10.25m. The total will be paid with &#xa3;6.36m from the issue of 5.36 million new ordinary shares in Tenon and the balance of &#xa3;3.89m in cash.&#xa0;The acquisition represents the first move by Tenon as it attempts to become a business services group. Ian Buckley, chief executive of Tenon, said: 'Morison Stoneham is a growing and profitable firm with a strong client base and reputation.This acquisition represents the first step in our strategy of establishing a broadly based business services group. We are confident that we can build on Morison Stoneham's growing profit trend through increased investment and active marketing.&#xa0;We continue to have discussions with a number of high-quality practices who are interested in becoming part of Tenon. We remain committed to establishing a new type of business services group that will have a major impact on the UK accountancy profession.&quot;<br>
<br>
I resigned as a MS partner to study as a lawyer, but retaining my insolvency appointments, I continued as a MS consultant for a number of years. I was proud to have established MS greenfield insolvency operations in London. Chelmsford and Guildford. To this day I remain close to MS and attend annual MS partner dinners organised by the former Managing Partner, Stephen Chang. MS alumni, please feel to LinkedIn.

    I trained as an ACA with Ernst &amp; Whinney (latterly Young): originally at their Chiswell St offices and then at Becket House. Allocated to an insurance/City audit group, I became adept at Lloyds accounting and investigations as my training coincided with the Lloyds scandals era. E&amp;Y was a fantastic employer. I enjoyed my time and would delighted to be LinkedIn to 'contemporaneous trainees'.

    Baywind Energy Conservation Trust (the Trust) was proposed at the planning stage of Baywind Energy Co-Op Ltd (Co-Op) and was established in 1998.<br>
<br>
0.5% of the Co-Op revenue goes to the Trust, which was around &#xa3;14,000 between 1997 and 2005. The Trust provides information and grants for energy efficiency measures within the locality of the turbines to individual homes and community organisations. The Trust received a &#xa3;5000 local authority grant in 2004 for home insulation in the local area.&#xa0;The Trust also provides educational visits for schools and interested adults.<br>
<br>
Being brought up in SW Cumbria it is a pleasure to return and put back something into the local community.<br>

<br>
The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) is a not-for-profit, UK registered charity working in the public interest through an international network of branches. It has a global membership of around 12,000 individuals who have professional training in private dispute resolution.<br>
<br>
In addition to providing education and training for arbitrators, mediators and adjudicators, the CIArb acts as an international centre for practitioners, policy makers, academics and those in business concerned with the cost-effective and early settlement of disputes.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
The London Branch is the largest in the UK, with over 1,300 members living and working in the Greater London area. The London branch committee, of which I am a member, provides London with a full CPD programme.<br>

<p class=" summary">
    The Wikipedia entry reads -&#xa0;<br>
<br>
&quot;[The] Worshipful Company of Arbitrators &#xa0;is the 93rd Livery Company of the City of London. The organisation became a Livery Company on 17 March 1981. The Company supports education in the field of arbitration. It also functions as a charitable institution. Its motto is Law and Custom.<br>
<br>
There are two major classes of members: Liverymen and Freemen. There is a limit of 300 Liverymen, all of whom must be freemen of the City of London. Being admitted as a Liveryman shows a dedication to good government and order. Only Liverymen may be part of the leadership of the Company; the Master, the Senior Warden, the Junior Warden and the Court of Assistants. Only Liverymen may nominate others for membership.<br>
<br>
Company freemen must be of good character and engaged in the practice of commercial arbitration (while older companies have tended to lose their link to their original occupations, newer companies are still closely tied to their vocations).<br>
<br>
The Company maintains a programme of activities which promotes arbitration and interest in arbitration of the City of London. In these matters it is determined to be at the leading edge of ideas and development, in ways which cross boundaries between different dispute resolution specialisations in all fields, including commerce and all business and domestic activities.<br>
<br>
The Company has established charitable trusts through which it expects to build substantial funds, with the aim of supporting education in the field of arbitration.<br>
<br>
It provides members with the opportunity of hearing from distinguished experts in the field and to exchange ideas and views in convivial surroundings. It is also dedicated to the promotion of the City of London as the centre of excellence for international dispute resolution.&quot;

    Nottingham University 'Guidelines For Honorary Appointments' note -<br>
<br>
&quot;The&#xa0;scheme for Honorary Professors is administered...[by] the Registrar's Office...There are 4 categories of Honorary Appointments...:<br>
<br>
Honorary Professor.<br>
Honorary Associate Professor.<br>
Honorary Lecturer.<br>
<br>
Honorary Appointments are part-time...the original aim of strengthening links with industry, commerce and...professions. They involve varying and flexible teaching duties...<br>
<br>
The categories represent different status in University terms and...the following guide may be helpful.<br>
<br>
The title Honorary Professor is appropriate for someone worthy of a Chair position at the University or the equivalent, ie. someone very eminent in their field. Nominations for serving academics from other universities (whether in the UK or abroad) may be considered only if they hold professorial positions within those institutions. Two references external to the University are required when submitting a nomination. Schools are responsible for taking up references and ensuring that the referees are of suitable seniority whether inside or outside academia. The recommendation for an appointment should include a note of the role or status of each referee. It is advisable to have one of the referees independent of the current employer of the person being nominated. In addition, existing Special/Honorary Professors should not be asked to provide references as this would not be considered to be external to the University.<br>
<br>
The title Honorary Associate Professor should only be conferred on those who would be deemed appropriate for an Associate Professor appointment within the University.<br>
<br>
Honorary Lecturer status applies to the majority of appointments made.<br>
<br>
Appointments are made for a three-year period, from 1 August, after which time the School has the option to renew the appointment for a further period. All letters of appointment to Honorary Professors are issued centrally and copied to the Head of School.<br>

<br>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) was established by a Royal Charter in 1880. It has over 130,000 members. Over 15,000 of these members live and work outside the UK. The Institute also has some 9,000 students.<br>
<br>
The ICAEW was formed from the five associations, one of which was the London Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) (as it became known) that existed in England prior to ICAEW establishment by Royal Charter.<br>
<br>
In 1871, standards for LSCA membership were established with new members having to show knowledge and aptitude through successfully passing an oral examination. Initially the London Institute restricted its membership to that city, but as other institutes were established elsewhere (for example, in Manchester and Sheffield) it was decided to remove this restriction and as such in 1872 it simply became known as the Institute of Accountants to reflect its new national coverage.<br>
<br>
The ICAEW now has 22 district societies, the largest of which is the LSCA with over 37,000 members. The LSCA has often taken the lead in making proposals for change and was instrumental in the formation of the influential Hundred Group of finance directors.<br>
<br>
The LSCA has a number if branches: Canary Wharf; North London, North West London, South West London, South East London and West London. It also operates through many specialist practice, sector and age committees. Such committees and branches provide a plethora of CPD opportunities.<br>
<br>
I am proud to have been the Deputy and Vice President, and now President of the LSCA.&#xa0;<br>
<br>
I welcome a LinkedIn invite from any LSCA member, who may also email me on ICAEW / LSCA matter of concern; and would encourage LSCA members to join the LSCA LinkedIn group.<br>

<p class=" summary">
    I was a London council member for the ICAEW from June 2008 until June 2011. Details as to the functioning responsibility of the ICAEW council can be found at: http://www.icaew.com/en/about-icaew/who-we-are/governance<br>
<br>
The Council is ICAEW&#x2019;s supreme governing body, responsible for oversight of its activities. Council agrees ICAEW&#x2019;s strategy and budget, delegating day to day operation to committees and staff.<br>
<br>
The majority of Council is elected by ICAEW members, supplemented by co-opted and ex officio members. This is to ensure that Council represents the main sectors and interests of the whole membership.<br>
<br>
ICAEW&#x2019;s Board has overall responsibility for ICAEW&#x2019;s planning and budgeting process and the development of policy. <br>
<br>
It is supported by four boards that oversee the main areas of ICAEW activity - Professional Standards Board, Learning and Professional Development, Member Services and the Technical Strategy.<br>
<br>
The Executive Leadership Team is responsible for the delivery of ICAEW&#x2019;s operational plan. It also has an important role in helping to shape ICAEW strategy. It is supported by the management team which includes Departmental Directors<br>

    A unique new guide to insolvency law, legal practice and asset-based lending. <br>
Asset-based lending has been a huge success within the UK debt market. However the onset of the international credit crisis has thrown ABL transactions into sharp focus, resulting in the need for specialist reference material and clear guidance for professionals tackling ABL and insolvency.<br>
This timely new guide from two leading experts will prove indispensable to lawyers handling insolvency law, asset-based lenders, and insolvency practitioners.<br>
Andrew Knight and Grant Jones unravel the legal scenarios and financial situations asset-based lenders must negotiate when dealing with an insolvent borrower. What options do you have, what legal issues determine the amount of recoverable debt, which approach is likely to ensure a successful outcome?<br>
These questions plus many more are answered within the pages of this specialist new resource.<br>
Asset-Based Lending and Insolvency outlines your options, and provides the practical tools and techniques to help recover debts, advances and assets - a clear competitive advantage.<br>

Grant Jones &amp; Peter Pexton.<br>
<br>
I am working on three publishing projects (aka books); the first of which is the above. Spiramus is to publish. The book will consist of two parts: part (a) a review of the issues facing trustees re ADR; &amp; part (b) a review of trustee jurisdictions re ADR from individual contributors resident in trust jurisdictions. Peter and I would be happy to receive contributions from trustee practitioners for inclusion into part (b).

    trust insolvency.<br>
<br>
I am working on three publishing projects (aka books); the third of which is the above. Publication is some time hence. The fundamental question is 'should there be a separate regime for trust insolvency, different to corporate and personal insolvency'?

    University League Table Rankings 2012.<br>
<br>
The Queen Mary Law School excelled in the Guardian's University 2012 Guide. The School was ranked 4th for law. Department Head Peter Alldridge noted: &quot;The guides are clear recognition that we offer a wonderful all round legal education.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only has the Law School been ranked very highly in the league tables, but also by its own students. In the most recent National Student Survey (NSS), our final year undergraduate students awarded QMC an impressive 94% for our efforts in delivering student satisfaction. This gives QMC  joint highest overall satisfaction ratings within the London University Law Schools. &quot;This high rating is a reason for pride, but not for complacency. Competition for the very best students is intense, and we are always trying to improve upon what we offer our students,&quot; explains Professor Alldridge.

Barrow Grammar School for Boys (BGSB) is now Park View Comprehensive. I would be delighted to hear from any 'Old Barrovian', especially those of my year at BGSB. I still visit Barrow as I have family there, but tend to attend Old Barrovian functions in London.
