<p class=" ''">
    Suffering from too much agreement. Is there such a thing as too much agreement among team members or on a project? Can too much 'getting along' actually keep work from moving forward, stifle much needed creativity, and foster passive resistance from your people? And as a leader, how do you know the difference between too much and just right? <br>
<br>
This session on Leading with Emotional Intelligence, Esther Orioli discusses why excessive &#x201c;second yessing&#x2122;&#x201d; often gets in the way of making important work happen, why leaders need to actively invite disagreement and how to measure yourself on Constructive Discontent. <br>
<br>
Samuel M. Lam, President of Linkage Asia, joins Esther to offer his insights and expertise with creating environments that invite different opinions and the strengths to be gained by welcoming discontent, rather than stifling it. Tune in to hear why encouraging people to voice their opinions, even when they &#x201c;rock the boat&#x201d; can be invaluable to a team, and most particularly to the folks at the top.

    Have you ever said or done something and regretted it later? Not sure why you acted in an uncharacteristic or not very &#x201c;leader-like&#x201d; way in an important meeting? Could be that your amygdala got the better of you. This episode on Leading with Emotional Intelligence explores how the amygdala, a tiny, almond-shaped part of the brain, often sends even the most thoughtful of us down a bad path and what you can do to stay in control and on task when you experience an &#x201c;amygdala attack.&#x201d; <br>
<br>
Dr. Mary Corbett of Australian Business Class joined Esther Orioli to discuss the latest in brain science behind amygdala attacks and how it relates to business performance and leadership. Hear how the brain&#x2019;s built-in mechanisms for protecting us from harm can lead to disastrous situations in the board room and how to manage your amygdala before it hijacks your better judgment.

    Contrary to popular belief, when it comes to making business decisions the heart, not the head, has the final say. On  this Valentine&#x2019;s show: The Heart Smarts of Business you&#x2019;ll learn why EQ rules over IQ when it comes to leadership success and why you can&#x2019;t leave emotions out of it (even if you wanted to). <br>
<br>
Discover how building trusting relationships is a powerful business trait among the best leaders who share the love of business.<br>
<br>
Research has shown that humans have a neurological imperative for human to human connections. Physically, emotionally, energetically and neurologically, human performance depends on the right amount of head, heart and gut-level smarts to make it in this business and economic climate.

<p class=" ''">
    Have you ever left a meeting shaking your head, wondering what happened? You knew before you started that you wanted to fire up your team about your new project. Somehow, it didn&#x2019;t quite work out that way. <br>
<br>
Perhaps you need the skills of intentionality to close the gap between what you needed and what you got. Intentionality is a critical emotional intelligence competency and can be learned, practiced and mastered by leaders struggling to make things happen. According to EQ Map, a statisticallly reliable measure of EI, Intentionality is: &#x201c;.. your ability to act deliberately, &quot;on purpose,&quot; to say what you mean and to mean what you say.&#x201d; <br>
<br>
Orioli says that &#x201c;the act of being unconscious does not mean you are intentionless, it simply means you are not driving the outcome.  What you are thinking, what you are avoiding, the words you use, the mood you are in, even the jokes you tell, are part of the process of communicating your intention.&#x201d;

<p class=" ''">
    What is emotional intelligence? Are you born with EQ or can you develop it? How does EQ make you a better leader? These are a few of the questions Esther Orioli, EQ and leadership expert, answers on today&#x2019;s program. <br>
<br>
Esther explores why EQ is the true stuff of success and is crucial to leaders&#x2019; ability to build trusting relationships, be effective even under pressure and create the future for their companies.

Using EQ Map&#xae;, Esther will show you how to measure your own EQ profile and take an EQ snapshot of your team. <br>
<br>
Tune in to find out how you can assess, practice and master essential EQ competencies and traits and bring them to the people you lead so they can bring their very best to the table each and every day.

<p class=" ''">
    With more than 294 billion emails sent every day, chances are many of them will miscommunicate in some significant EQ way: hostile tone, capital letter shouting, volatile language, diluted message, truncated meanings &#x2013; all sorts of problems. Without the nuances that seeing each other face to face allow, mistakes, misfires and miscommunication abound. When does the convenience of email get outweighed by the harmful and sometimes irreparable side effects that only email can bring? As a leader, how can you capitalize on the urgency and immediacy that email provides without risking the catastrophes?<br>
<br>
The difference is the high EQ email &#x2013; communicating in this day and age requires a different written form to get it right and keep it short. Tune in this week to LEI and join Esther Orioli as she discusses using email as an effective leadership tool, what type of information should go in an email, when you should pick up the phone and why face-to-face is mandatory for certain conversations.

    As a leader, on a scale of 1 to 10, how good are you at being intentional, staying resilient, letting others disagree, unleashing your creativity and connecting with your people? Need some help? Most of us do. These sophisticated EQ traits, while not the easiest to learn, ensure your success and ability to lead by example and create great organizations. <br>
<br>
From cohesive work teams, to stellar customer service, to innovative products, to building trust, study after study shows that high emotional intelligence (EQ) is key to amazing performance within companies. While many believe that EQ is something you either have or don&#x2019;t, the good news is that EQ, the ability to sense, understand and apply the power and acumen of emotions, is a skill that can be learned.

    Have you ever had to implement a new system or a large-scale change for your team, department or organization? Been the point person on a customer service overhaul? Had to deal with problem performers with non-productive behaviors?<br>
<br>
Then you know how tough this can be. Moving your team from resistance to making change happen can be a daunting task. How do you share just the right information, in just the right way to help your people intellectually understand as well as emotionally embrace new behaviors and practices? Seasoned leaders know that &#x201c;culture trumps strategy&#x201d; and that the key to success lies in changing the hearts and minds of their people.

<p class=" ''">
    Like it or not, we spend more time with those with whom we work than with just about anyone else &#x2013; more than our family, more than our friends, more than even our spouses. Unlike our friends, we do not choose the people we work with, unlike our family, they are not connected to us by blood. So how can we define these relationships and where do we draw the line for how much we share with colleagues, co-workers and bosses? What are the implications for leaders as we put forth our best efforts to both befriend and guide our employees? <br>
<br>
Great leaders know that getting work done through others requires more than a job description and a paycheck, it mandates a way to connect. And  true connection means being seen and feeling valued. It is an emotional, rather than intellectual issue.This week&#x2019;s show explores the special challenge of how leaders make connections, show empathy and motivate their people to bring their very best to the table day after day.

    Peter Drucker, the late great management guru wrote: &#x201c;Your foremost job as a leader is to take charge of your own energy and then to orchestrate the energy of others.&#x201d; Easier said than done. How do we as leaders change our own bad habits before we ask our people to change theirs? <br>
<br>
As leaders, we are often required to implement all kinds of changes with our teams and departments and sometimes even for the entire organization. How do we lead by example around changing our own behavior before orchestrating change in the group? Knowing how to make change for ourselves, as individuals, becomes vitally important before asking others to do so.<br>
<br>
What if there was a simple, step-by-step method for making any kind of change you wanted any time you wanted? Join Esther Orioli this week on LEI as she discusses habit creation eTools, what types of behaviors can be improved and how you can make measurable, sustainable life changes the 21 Day Way.

    There is perhaps nothing more challenging for leaders than implementing large scale strategic change efforts within organizations. Shifting from the usual ways of doing things, to the new and unfamiliar, wreaks havoc with organizational systems, processes and people. Experienced leaders know that information alone is not enough to ensure successful transitions. Moving people and systems from Point A to Point B requires preparation, engagement and accountability. Most importantly, the &#x201c;gotta wanna&#x201d; factor needs to be instilled in the application of these transitions if you hope to move the mountain, even a little.<br>
<br>
What is the bottom line for changing group behavior and culture? What are the steps? How do you motivate even the most resistant of teams to get on board?

<p class=" ''">
    Leaders are required to, well, lead. And make decisions. They must choose a course of action and ask others to work towards that goal, to follow them in their endeavors, to believe in the outcome. <br>
<br>
So as a leader how do you stay present? Assimilate information from many sources? Sense the situation with the client or company? Take the best from the past and get an intuitive read of the future?<br>
<br>
Join Esther and her featured guest Scott Blessing as they discuss leadership presence, the &quot;interactional leader&quot; and using EQ in the decision making process in your heads, hearts and boardrooms. <br>

    Don't Believe Everything You Feel: Know Your EQ Type <br>
<br>
When the pressure is on, many of us resort to our most familiar and characteristic ways of acting. It makes sense; with chaos, conflict or surprise we grab on to the most ingrained and automatic response available to get us through the crisis. But are our habitual responses the best ones for all situations? <br>
<br>
For leaders knowing your &quot;EQ Type&quot; can help you understand your default behaviors and expand your choices before making decisions or taking action.<br>
<br>
Join host Esther Orioli and her featured guest Dutch author, consultant and facilitator Sjaak Overbeeke, as they discuss the &quot;Thinker,&quot; the &quot;Feeler,&quot; and the &quot;Doer,&quot;  and how the EQ type you are informs the actions you take and what you can do to achieve more balance.<br>

    Is it any wonder that the Best Places to Work in America also have the highest levels of emotional intelligence? Every year, Forbes teams up with the Best Places to Work Institute to evaluate the very best. Given that the highest ranked items are employee levels of trust, pride, and camaraderie, as well as management credibility and job satisfaction, leaders need to create environments that not only attract the very best talent but keep them engaged and satisfied. <br>

    Even the strongest leader can get sick, can suffer with debilitating illness, can suddenly have to go from &#x201c;unstoppable&#x201d; to &#x201c;gotta stop now.&#x201d; When you're a leader and you get sick serious questions immediately arise. How much do you share with your colleagues? Your team? Your clients? How do you logistically and emotionally handle being absent from the office? How do you reassure and stay in touch with your people?<br>
<br>
This week on Leading with Emotional Intelligence join Esther and her featured guest Bruce Cryer, author, speaker and CEO of HeartMath, as they discuss their real life experiences as leaders who suddenly found themselves in the position of reluctant patient. Hear how they applied their own work in EQ, stress and resiliency to deal with their uncertainties, maneuver the medical system and publically embrace the position of Leader Heal Thyself.<br>

    If waiting could only make it so... <br>
Many folks, leaders included, spend a great deal of time waiting for something to happen: for performance to improve, for creativity to blossom, for a problem situation to turn itself around. <br>
<br>
The bad news:<br>
Scientific evidence now shows that the longer you wait for something to occur, the less likely it is to happen regardless of how much you want it.<br>
<br>
The good news:<br>
Don&#x2019;t despair - the power to make things happen lies within us, is not that difficult to access, and it&#x2019;s not just emotional, it&#x2019;s biochemical.<br>
<br>
<br>
This week on LEI join Esther Orioli, and her featured guest Dr. Julia Shumelda, for a fascinating discussion about the power of emotional intelligence, receptivity and the secrets to reversing the &#x201c;When-Then&#x201d; Syndrome. Find out how one simple EQ skill can change your biochemistry, bolster your resilience, and instill neuro conditions that stoke creativity.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    Show me the numbers! Show me the data! You&#x2019;ve heard this mantra before. As leaders we have all had to deal with colleagues, supervisors and team members who doubt the real impact of emotional intelligence at work. In fact, some of the most resistant to embracing EQ are the ones most in need of its benefits. While programmers, accountants, lawyers, and engineers are often thought to lead the hit parade of &#x2018;doubting Thomases&#x2019;, they are not by any means the only ones. So how do you get people in these and other IQ-centric fields to recognize and utilize the valuable assets that come from developing and using their EQ?<br>
<br>
Tune in to LEI this week and join Esther Orioli and her featured guest Laurie Hillis as they discuss the business case for building EQ, how to coach senior leadership in high tech environments, and the logical, practical, simple mechanisms that all people can implement to get the benefits of bringing their emotional brain into the mix.<br>

    Could EQ save your life? <br>
Western medicine has made a tremendous difference in quality of life for many people. We now live longer, have more life-saving technology available to us and can replace worn out body parts through the marvels of science. Progress has even been made in treating and curing many kinds of cancer. But Western medicine is still often lacking in EQ &#x2013; the mind, heart, body connections - that alternative and Eastern medicine practitioners have long recognized and used to heal. How do we remedy the situation of West vs. East and incorporate the best of both worlds for optimal healing?<br>
<br>
Tune in to LEI this week and join Esther Orioli and her featured guests Robert Gorter, M.D. and Erik Peper, Ph.D., for a lively conversation of why modern medicine often barks up the wrong tree when it comes to understanding and treating cancer and the new ways emotional intelligence can be used to fight disease.<br>

    The Whole Truth And Nothing But The Truth?<br>
The whole truth sounds like a good idea. Most business leaders and companies will tell you they strive for transparency, to build better relationships with clients and the public by being completely up-front about behind-the-scenes. But is it possible for the C-Suite to be fully transparent yet still protect confidentiality and fulfill the mission with which they are charged? <br>
<br>
Check out LEI this week as Esther Orioli and her featured guest Cheryl Esposito, host of Voice America&#x2019;s Leading Conversations, discuss leadership transparency and living under the media microscope in business.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    &quot;Be creative!&quot; &quot;Innovate.&quot; &quot;Think outside the box!&quot;  Great directives but serendipity, an aptitude for making desirable discoveries by accident, requires a particular set of conditions, often found in startup companies, in order to have those &quot;Ah Ha&quot; moments.<br>
<br>
Unlike startups, mature organizations often seek to minimize risk. Yet the very structure that ensures this safety usually stifles creativity and innovation which thrive on the antithesis of calm. Can the need for stability and the need to take chances live simultaneously in any system?

    What They're Not Saying: How do you get people to really talk? <br>
<br>
One of the worst problems many organizations face is: Silence. Teams not sharing information among staff or between teams. Individuals keeping good ideas to themselves because &#x201c;nobody asked me.&#x201d; One department actively &#x201c;hoarding&#x201d; data that other departments need to make decisions. Some silence may be cultural or based on class or gender or type of leadership. Regardless, the toll that limited communication takes on the company&#x2019;s mission and message is undeniable.<br>
<br>
As a leader how do you get people to really talk with one another? Teach and incent new norms around information sharing? Use self interest to move people from competitive to collaborative? Manage and deal with &#x201c;cliques&#x201d; in your department?<br>
<br>
On this week&#x2019;s episode of LEI, Esther Orioli and her featured guest Phil Corbett of Australian Business Class break down which leader behaviors create or negate the &#x201c;silo effect&#x201d;, using EQ to set intention in communications and what guys like to talk about.<br>

    From X to Z (and Boomers too) <br>
Leading Four Generations At Work <br>
You&#x2019;re the leader, charged with managing, motivating and getting work done through other people. Other people of different generations, genders, management status, backgrounds, and cultures who have different values, ideas, ways of communicating and getting things done.<br>
<br>
As roles constantly evolve and rules are being rewritten at work are there any constants that leaders can build on to satisfy and motivate the masses? Where does emotional intelligence fit in and how is it being defined and used by each group?<br>
<br>
On this week&#x2019;s episode of LEI, Esther Orioli and her featured guests, Sindri Anderson and Pamela Hopkins of Enact Global Consulting, discuss how leaders can play to the strengths of diversity, Boomers, Gens X, Y and Z and why assessing and developing EQ strengths and vulnerabilities is an easy-to-implement solution for making all your &#x201c;other people&#x201d; into one cohesive team.<br>

    Getting The Corner Office: How &quot;Nice Girls&quot; Become Winning Women <br>
Women leaders are often caught in a bind due to ingrained gender roles and different societal expectations about how men and women should behave.<br>
<br>
How can women be outspoken, directive and not afraid to &#x2018;rock the boat&#x2019; as directors, managers, and CEOs when they feel pressure to be soft spoken, nurturing, and to worry about others&#x2019; reactions? How do they overcome the very real fear that if they speak their minds they&#x2019;ll be seen as &#x201c;a bitch?&#x201d; What EQ strategies and tactics can they use to transcend the need to be &#x201c;nice girls&#x201d; at work and become effective, respected leaders?<br>
<br>
Whether you&#x2019;re a woman who needs some tips to succeed or a man who wants to motivate and maximize the skills of your female colleagues, you&#x2019;ll want to join Esther Orioli and her featured guest Dr. Lois Frankel, author of Nice Girls Just Don&#x2019;t Get It, for this no holds barred discussion.

    Building EQ To Match IQ <br>
Hiring new people is a big part of a leader&#x2019;s job and crucial to meeting the needs of its clients. We rush to hire IQ smart people, the brightest candidates who have a depth of knowledge in our particular field, and just assume they&#x2019;ll get along with everybody and navigate interactions with clients and peers successfully. But what if they don&#x2019;t?<br>
<br>
Many times new hires, particularly in the legal, finance, engineering and tech worlds, don&#x2019;t realize that EQ skills are just as vital to fulfilling their duties as writing an ironclad contract or a solid app when it comes to keeping the clients (and their boss) happy. So how can they learn what they don&#x2019;t know they need to learn? And as leaders how can we proactively, yet respectfully, help them?<br>
<br>
This week on LEI, Esther Orioli and her featured guests, Matt Allegrucci and Madeline Dillon from Daiichi Sankyo, discuss hiring, managing and developing talent around EQ and its importance to getting work done and done well.

    For The Love Of Money: EQ And Financial Values <br>
Financial security is a huge driver of human behavior. We strive for it, we chase it, we achieve it or fall short and, if we know how, we plan for it. But with all the focus on money in our society, and the crucial role it plays in our lives, you&#x2019;d think we&#x2019;d all be better at it.<br>
<br>
Why then are some people more successful at making money and keeping it? And, as entrepreneurs and leaders, how can we tell the difference between external influences on our businesses, like the recession, and true mismanagement of time, money and resources that may be holding us back?<br>
<br>
This week on LEI, Esther Orioli and her featured guest Valerie Coleman Morris discuss how our emotions can guide or overwhelm us and the steps you can take to get to financial self-reliance.<br>

    The Attributes of Leaders: How Who You Are Effects What They Do <br>
Wanted: Smart, enthusiastic individual who can imagine the future of the company and has the know how to make it happen. Works well with others, inspiring them to bring their ideas and energy to the table and motivating them to push past their last best effort. Must be willing to make tough decisions. Mind blowing charisma a plus but not required. <br>
<br>
Ok maybe this isn&#x2019;t what the job description for a leader looks like yet it&#x2019;s the basics of what we hope most leaders will have. But let&#x2019;s get personal. Do you know your strengths as a leader? If you asked others, would they say that&#x2019;s what they are? When the pressure is on, what guides your inner compass so you have the resources to make decisions that truly reflect who you are?<br>
<br>
This week on LEI Esther Orioli, and her featured guest Rob McHardy, discuss how to assess and fine tune your character as a leader to engage the hearts and minds of your people and make life a whole lot easier on yourself.<br>

    Separating Substance From Spin <br>
How PR Firms Use EQ To Promote <br>
With the increased emphasis on corporate transparency these days, public relations, advertising and the media (social and otherwise) are working overtime to bring us more and more details about what their clients are doing. But how does the public separate the substance from the buzz, the reality from the hype, the truth from the spin? And how do the companies who act from core values of full disclosure and giving back separate themselves from those who only give the appearance of doing so?<br>
<br>
As leaders we often face similar issues when sharing information from the top down. Rumors fly fast and loose via email or the break room and the crux of matters often gets misplaced. How can you control your own information hub so your people get the same message with the same intent to stem the tide of false or exaggerated data?<br>
<br>
Join Esther and her guest media expert Ann Barlow, from the public relations firm Peppercom, for a look at creating spin that promotes for good and how the spotlight can turn companies around.<br>

     Finding The Meaning Again <br>
There was a reason you wanted to be a leader, although some days it may be hard to remember why. Getting work done through others can be a tough and thankless job and, since leadership is a top down situation, if you&#x2019;re less than enthusiastic about the work your team will be too.<br>
<br>
How do you get the spark back? And how can you bring excitement and energy to your group to boost morale, turn around bad attitudes and reinvigorate them in their day-to-day efforts?<br>
<br>
Tune in this week to LEI as Esther Orioli discusses steps leaders can take to get back the meaning, how to &#x201c;contain the drain&#x201d; and three things you can do tomorrow to wake up your people.<br>

    Mood Matters. <br>
Whether you&#x2019;re walking into a restaurant, a retail store, or an office, the subtle (or not so subtle) mood of the place makes a powerful statement about the organization, its products and the people who work there. This first impression can influence how long you&#x2019;ll stay, what you&#x2019;ll say to others about your experience, and whether you&#x2019;d ever return.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, the most significant factor that contributes to the climate and tone of the environment is THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MANAGER. Managers and the leaders above them, intentionally or not, set the &#x201c;mood&#x201d; and the standards for the people who report to them thus dictating by proxy how clients and the public feel about the service they receive and the organization as a whole.<br>
<br>
Join Esther Orioli, and her featured guest Jeff Patnaude, to get the inside skinny on how to measure and manage mood, what leaders can do to help others to manage theirs, and creating a climate where people can be well and do well.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    And in the beginning there was commerce. <br>
Ok not really.  In early societies the main engines of culture centered around religion or politics. Priests and politicians were anointed to lead with the responsibility of looking out for the wellbeing of their communities.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to the last five hundred years or so. Commerce is now the primary force propelling society and businesses are compelled to take on vital roles in the communities they inhabit through job creation, revenue generation and philanthropy. Business leaders, in addition to their responsibilities within the company, are now the caretakers of their community&#x2019;s needs and interest.<br>
<br>
This week on LEI join Esther Orioli and her featured guest Ayman Sawaf, author and entrepreneur, as they get into the evolutionary path of corporations and the return to sacred commerce.

    Long Live The King! (not so much) <br>
Benevolent dictators, organizations abound with them but, while it may seem like it&#x2019;s business as usual, the old way of doing things by command and control doesn&#x2019;t work anymore, particularly when leading the younger generations. This type of CEO or director often operates from pure ego and the cognitive arena, shutting down dialogue, stifling creativity and draining energy from the people who work for them. Not an easy person to live with on a day-to-day basis. <br>
What can you do if you work for a benevolent dictator? What can you do if you think YOU might be a benevolent dictator?<br>
<br>
Tune in to LEI this week as Esther Orioli and her featured guests Robert Culver and Melissa Kopplin delve into the mindset of the benevolent dictator, how his or her behavior keeps people from working to their maximum potential and what EQ mechanisms you can use to neutralize them before they wreck the place.

    Owning A Business: Do you have what it takes? <br>
Entrepreneurs are people who LOVE the world of business. They anticipate opportunities in the market place and have the sheer drive, chutzpah, and persistence to go after them. What sets the entrepreneur apart from the everyday professional? It&#x2019;s their EQ (Entrepreneurial Quotient).<br>
<br>
Whether you&#x2019;re a social, serial or lifestyle entrepreneur you&#x2019;ll need  vision, innovation, intention and a host of other emotional intelligence skills to be resilient enough to handle the risk and ambiguity that are constants in the lives of those who follow their passions and become their own boss.<br>
<br>
Join Esther Orioli and her featured guest Sharon Miller as they weigh in on the relationship of EQ (emotional intelligence) to EQ (entrepreneurial quotient), five common mistakes most startups make and where you can learn how to start your own company.

<br>
Being excited about what you do is critical to successful leaders and there&#x2019;s nothing like taking chances to ramp up the old adrenaline. Without risk and dealing with fear of failure leaders stagnate, and if you&#x2019;re not putting yourself out there then chances are your people aren&#x2019;t doing it either. Things bog down, creativity is hampered and your ability to hit goals and achieve greatness becomes truly impossible. It&#x2019;s way too much business as usual.<br>
<br>
How do you summon risk, become a thought leader and get the party started? Join Esther Orioli and her featured guest Liz Cornish, author, leadership expert and adventure enthusiast, as they talk steps for pushing yourself past your last known best, treats for tricking yourself to take chances, how to set unrealistic expectations and why the payoff for being out there is huge for you and your company.

    Getting To Yes<br>
When it comes to negotiations many of us may wish for a Hollywood stunt double. It&#x2019;s not easy to ask for the sale, get clients to sign on the bottom line or work with colleagues to reach agreements that move work forward.<br>
<br>
An even bigger challenge? Negotiating for what you want or need without making the other party feel bullied, manipulated or compromised in a way that damages relationships, current and future. <br>
<br>
On this episode of LEI master negotiator Carol Frohlinger joins host Esther Orioli for an everything-on-the-table discussion of how leaders can successfully negotiate touchy topics, close the deal, and eliminate &quot;The Tiara Syndrome.&quot;<br>

    A Special Thanksgiving For Every Day Gratitude <br>
While much is made about salaries, titles and perks we often forget about the most powerful incentive that we as leaders have &#x2013; appreciation. Even the smallest expression of gratitude can connect us to those we most want to connect with simply by noticing and saying, &#x201c;Thanks for sharing your thoughts at the meeting&#x201d; or &#x201c;I so appreciate how you stay on top of things.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
But if saying &#x201c;good job&#x201d; is so easy why don&#x2019;t more of us do it more often? And how can we model this behavior so all the people on our team keep it going too? On this special Thanksgiving show Esther Orioli talks turkey about the price of thanks that goes unspoken, how to increase your emotional expression, and three behaviors leaders can do to promote gratitude.<br>

Tune in to learn how to identify the telltale warning signs of a potential problem, three crucial ways to protect those most vulnerable and the aspects of EQ that prevent &#x201c;toxic leadership.&#x201d;

    Something's Not Working: How To Solve The Mystery <br>
You&#x2019;re climbing your way up the corporate ladder but can&#x2019;t seem to get ahead. You&#x2019;re smart, you&#x2019;re hard working, heck you&#x2019;re even emotionally intelligent, so why do you keep getting derailed?<br>
<br>
There are many reasons for getting stalled in your career track: not knowing your way around the system, needing the right introductions to the right people, ignorance of the office politics. But the biggest obstacle to your success may be&#x2026;yourself! In this episode of LEI mentoring expert Dr. Lois Zachary joins host Esther Orioli to discuss why you may be your own worst enemy when it comes to succeeding in business and what you need to know when it comes to moving up in your career.<br>

    Happiness Is The Bottom Line:The Serious Case For Serious Fun <br>
When it comes to injecting fun into the workplace very few organizations get beyond casual Fridays. Often the &#x201c;symptoms&#x201d; of happiness are frowned upon (&#x201c;quit laughing and get back to work&#x201d;), with leaders assuming that quiet, heads down people are more productive than those who eagerly and energetically engage with each other.<br>
<br>
Why incent fun? Because the byproducts of happy employees and a fun place to work are increased energy, trust, innovation and the ability to be resilient during even the toughest times. Craig Dexheimer, director of Operations and Administration for SALO, a financial staffing firm, joins Esther Orioli to discuss his company&#x2019;s case study on creating a culture of happiness, and the steps you can take as a leader to increase happiness for the good of the bottom line. <br>

    Holding Folks Accountable <br>
&#x201c;Joe was taking care of that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Mary dropped the ball in the meeting.&#x201d; &#x201c;I thought the project manager was giving the client a call.&#x201d; Do any of these phrases sound familiar?<br>
<br>
Accountability. There&#x2019;s usually not enough of it in any organization. And it&#x2019;s one leadership tool that desperately needs to be in the box.  As leaders when we hold ourselves and others responsible for things within our control it supports structure and operating norms, builds trust, and helps teams track and measure progress. Lack of accountability often leads to finger pointing, missed deadlines, inertia, empty promises, damaging relationships with clients and colleagues and, ultimately, losing business.<br>
<br>
On this episode of LEI host Esther Orioli and featured guest Marita Fridjhon, CEO of CRR Global, Inc., discuss making and holding people responsible in the workplace, using Systems Intelligence to create form out of chaos, and how to empower, not micromanage, with accountability. <br>

    Unconscious Stereotyping In The C-Suite <br>
Why are there still so few women in the C-Suite? This question plagues women who strive for senior positions and those organizations who recognize that there are strong statistical correlations between large numbers of senior women, financial performance and organizational health.<br>
<br>
According to a recent study &#x201c;unconscious stereotyping&#x201d; is often the obstacle that keeps women from rising to the top-of-the-house and staying there. On this myth busting episode of LEI host Esther Orioli and her featured guest Wendy Beecham discuss why diversity programs fail, what causes the &#x201c;leaky&#x201d; talent pipeline when it comes to promoting women, and how organizations can eradicate entrenched beliefs that keep the 2-3% of women CEO&#x2019;s from having more female company at the top.
