    The Hidden Woman of the Heart Bible Study is the result of Cindy&#x2019;s quest to seek for real answers and an accurate picture of what God wants in a godly woman. Cindy has spent her entire marriage digging into the Word for God&#x2019;s plan for godly womanhood. After all of these years, her own study and notes are finally available for others to join her in this journey through Scripture. Want to &#x201c;dip&#x201d; into the study? We have each section of the study ALSO available in separate guides--see more information on those by clicking the name of this book above.

    Another great Notebooking pack! This one goes back to Elisabeth&#x2019;s need for something DO-ABLE so she could begin studying from her English From The Roots Up book. Cindy developed what they were already doing across their curriculum, making pages that were ready to go for Matthew and Elisabeth. Now, they are available for you too! All you need to do is open, print, and use! Includes instructions and enough pages to correlate with the English From The Roots Up book. Add these pages to your own 3-ring binder, plastic sheet protectors, and English From The Roots Up Book and you will be set!

    Do you absolutely LOVE reading? Need a little help with keeping a record all along the way? Well, help that is EASY to implement in your busy home? This is the set for you! This set was originally designed for use in the very busy Rushton Home. As Matthew and Elisabeth grew older, they were learning so much more on their own than just the lessons planned and recorded by Cindy. The only answer was for them to be trained to do it themselves. What you see was the result. This e-book includes ready-to-print or copy today. Just follow the easy directions and your student will be keeping records today!

    We are SO excited to be introducing this FUN resource! This set is the result of creating reproducible pages for my children to use as they study through the Sue Gregg Baking with Whole Grains Cooking Course. Of course, these reproducible pages are perfect for you to use with or without the course. Perhaps you are wanting to MAKE YOUR OWN Family Recipe Book. Well, this resource would be perfect for you too. All you will need to do is add a notebook, plastic sheet protectors, and copies of these printable masters. Oh, and your favorite recipes! Sure to be a MUST for you and your family! We are pleased to provide for you ready-to-use pages for your Homemaking/Cooking Course Notebooks. Just as many of you, we are currently studying Baking with Whole Grains. We have adapted this program to fit our own family. One of the adaptations that has made a world of difference is that we are creating our notebooks so that we not only include recipes from the cooking course, but we also collect and include other favorites from our family. As we have developed this idea, the outcry has been tremendous for a packet, complete and ready-to-use for busy homeschooling families. I believe that you will find this resource to make homeschooling much, much EASIER! Just make your recipe notebook completely individual from your page colors to pictures of YOU and your meals to stickers to a wide variety of recipe clips. You probably have many ideas of what you want already, but just in case we included some examples of our Recipe Notebooks just in case you have no idea where to begin! There is NO wrong way to use this book&#x2026;well, except if you DON&#x2019;T use it at all! The RIGHT way is to have a blast using it! The best part about this book is that YOU are the author of this book. YOU are the illustrator of this book! So, have fun! Make YOUR OWN heirloom. Oh, and share it with a friend!

<p class=" ''">
    People pleasing. Enough said? I come from a long line of people pleasers. Oh, it isn't all bad! Being a people pleaser is a wonderful quality of a business owner...and a minister...and an employee...and a friend...and a relative, well you get the idea! :) Of course, people pleasing can be a two-edged sword. It can take you places that you don't want to go and cause you to do things that you do not want to do. Need some help balancing this one? Need to break free from people pleasing and learn how to handle those difficult, impossible-to-please-people in your life so you can become a healthy, happy, rock-solid people pleaser? Oh! This is YOUR set!

    When I got married, I was given a beautiful cross-stitch picture. It said, &quot;The greatest work that you will ever do will be within the walls of your own home.&quot; That one gift has influenced my life since that night that it was given to me. It is sooo true! We can do so many things with our lives. However, what really counts, what really matters, what really answers to the call is when we step up to the call to minister. Yes! YOU too! You are called and equipped to minister! This month, our series is just that word of encouragement, inspiration and practical help that will help you as you step up to your call.

    If there is one snare that the enemy loves to set before all of us, it is unforgiveness. Unforgiveness will take us where we don't want to go and cost us more than we want to pay. We have to be on guard! It sounds easy, but forgiveness can be very, very tough. We all get opportunities on a daily basis to walk in forgiveness or to choose unforgiveness and let it loose to eat away at us. Forgiveness is the BIG fix-it. I promise that it will fix that THING that may be eating away at you. It will protect you from mistakes that steal away the life and relationships that you want. It is powerful! Want a set that you will listen to over and over and over? This is it!
