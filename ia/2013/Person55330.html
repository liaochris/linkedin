    On Jan. 17, Apple Inc. reported that CEO Steve Jobs will be taking an unexpected medical leave, a press release which led to Apple&#x2019;s stock closing down 3 percent the following trading day.<br>
<br>
This is a big problem; no company beyond the start-up phase should be so dependent on its CEO that its future is uncertain when the CEO leaves.  <br>

    After the news broke about the Commanding Officer of the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) being relieved of command, I forwarded the story to my Naval Academy class listserv asking for comment about it. One of the important points brought out by my classmates &#x2014; many of whom are currently in command of ships and facilities around the world &#x2014; was that even if Captain Honors was achieving or exceeding all of his performance metrics, you simply can&#x2019;t have a senior officer of a ship acting this way. This is not an issue of political correctness run amok: A leader should treat all his/her subordinates with respect. To paraphrase some of the points...

    As we begin a new year, many of us take time to consider what we accomplished over the last year and what things we would like to change. This year will be the year that we will finally lose weight, get healthier, get in better shape, get organized, or improve our businesses. Many of us, however, have discovered that New Year&#x2019;s resolutions &#x2013; like many goals &#x2013; rarely get accomplished. Therefore, given the time of year, I thought it would be a good time for me to take a break from analysis and share a couple of the things that I&#x2019;ve learned about goals...

    I received a number of excellent comments on LinkedIn and in person regarding my blog update from a few weeks ago: &#x201c;Marketing, Innovation..and Training.&#x201d; Quite a bit of the discussion was surrounding the leadership principle of &#x201c;be friendly, not friends.&#x201d; What this means is that whereas you should definitely be friendly with your subordinates, you can create some big problems for yourself &#x2013; and your organization &#x2013; if you are friends with any of your subordinates.<br>
<br>
So, what&#x2019;s the difference between being friendly and being friends...?

<p class=" ''">
    A few months ago, The Wall Street Journal carried this interesting article about business names: &#x201c;What's in a Name? Potential Pitfalls.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
Even if your business is beyond the start-up phase, the possibility of changing the name of your business is always there. Kentucky Fried Chicken rebranded as KFC. Phillip Morris changed its name to Altria. Amway North America changed into three names: Alticor, the parent company, Quixtar, the direct selling company, and Access Business Group, the manufacturing company. Now the Quixtar name has been retired and Amway is back again.<br>
<br>
So, reviewing in's-and-out's of business naming periodically is a worthwhile exercise...

<p class=" ''">
    Each of us in a business leadership role understands the importance of investing in marketing and innovation, but how do we feel about training? Too often, companies hire sales or business development staff and put them through trial by fire &#x2014; the new employees will either rise to the occasion and make their numbers or they will crash and burn. Companies will also often promote someone into a leadership role who has never had a single course on leadership, simply because he was the best at his job &#x2014; or the most senior &#x2014; but then he fails to perform adequately in the new role.<br>
<br>
At the U.S. Naval Academy, we learned leadership through both the classroom and through mentor-guided practical application. Although we all probably had some natural ability walking in the door...

    A few weeks ago I wrote about Google CEO Eric Schmidt&#x2019;s interview with The Wall Street Journal, where he stated that he didn&#x2019;t see Facebook as a competitor to Google (see &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Hit Anything You Can&#x2019;t See&#x201d;). My observation was that Schmidt was either being na&#xef;ve or coy about his firm&#x2019;s strategy (I believe the latter). On Nov. 15, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of a new messaging service, which will provide users with an &quot;@facebook.com&quot; email address and will integrate a user&#x2019;s email, Facebook messaging, instant messaging, and SMS text.<br>
<br>
I agree with Zuckerberg that this won&#x2019;t kill Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc....

    I listened to local businessman Ken Kessler share some lessons from his entrepreneurial journey at a luncheon a few days ago. Ken founded and later sold a company named Kessler Soils Engineering Products Inc.<br>
<br>
A big part of their worldwide business is evaluating the condition of the soil upon which someone&#x2019;s planning to build a road or a runway. If you don&#x2019;t have a good handle on how the foundation is going to handle the weight of the trucks, airplanes, etc., that will be on the top of the asphalt, you won&#x2019;t know what hidden surprises will eventually show up on the surface...

    This article from The Wall Street Journal, brought to mind the issue that every business owner needs to plan for: exiting the business.<br>
<br>
Author Steven Covey popularized the concept of beginning &#x201c;with the end in mind&#x201d; in his book &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;, and it&#x2019;s a concept that most business owners don&#x2019;t put into practice.<br>

How do you know if your business is designed to be sold...?

<p class=" ''">
    I was out buying a bike for my son&#x2019;s birthday over the weekend, and I was planning on going to the same store where I bought all the bikes in our family: Bike Doctor of Crofton. The shop is one of eight independently owned Bike Doctor franchises throughout Maryland. (The headquarters is in Arnold.) One of the incentives the shop offers is a &#x201c;trade-up&#x201d; program on children&#x2019;s bikes that you buy from them. As children grow out of their bikes, you can trade-up and get money towards bigger bikes.<br>
<br>
On my way to Crofton, though, I decided to check out a bike shop a little closer to my house in Annapolis. I asked the owner if he offers a similar incentive as Crofton Bike Doctor. He told me no and gave me reasons why (liability, warranty, squirrels, blah, blah&#x2026;), so I walked out the door and headed to Crofton...

<p class=" ''">
    I have an affinity for listening to the &#x201c;how I did it&#x201d; stories of leaders. It&#x2019;s one of the reasons I volunteer with the local chapter of The Entrepreneurs Club of America. Rather than just getting a pedagogical list of &quot;how-to&#x2019;s&quot; (who wants to be preached to?), a story allows us to take away the things we need for our own businesses by applying our own context.<br>
<br>
I recently re-listened to Ted Leonsis&#x2019; 2008 interview on Leaders Portfolio. Leonsis is a genuinely successful entrepreneur: At 24, he started his first company &#x2014; raising $1 million of venture capital &#x2014; and then sold it two years later for $60 million. I have almost 2 pages of notes from the interview, and here are just a few business insights I gained from listening...

<p class=" ''">
    When I was a submarine officer on the USS Philadelphia (SSN-690), I learned the two most important rules of navigation:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Rule No. 1: Don&#x2019;t hit anything you can see.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Rule No. 2: Don&#x2019;t hit anything you can&#x2019;t see.<br>
<br>
Although these rules are obvious, they do capture the essence of navigating a ship at sea. Just because the obstacles are unseen, it doesn&#x2019;t mean they won&#x2019;t cause great damage to your ship or your crew. An unfortunate example of this is the tragic collision of the USS San Francisco with an uncharted undersea mountain in 2005.<br>
<br>
One thing we know for sure is that current technologies will eventually be obsolete...

    Most business owners accept that creating a simple business plan is critical to financing their business, but few understand the importance of continuing the discipline of updating the plan throughout the life of their business.<br>
<br>
A great economy can hide a multitude of business-planning sins, but when an economy turns, companies with well-designed and implemented plans have the best chance to survive and make the most of opportunities.<br>
<br>
A business plan outlines how your company will carry out your strategy and provides metrics to evaluate your organization&#x2019;s performance against that plan.<br>

Here is how to build an effective plan...

    ast month, I wrote about the importance of thinking and acting like a chief executive officer. The next step in becoming a CEO, not just an owner who is a glorified employee, is designing your business now to be sold later.<br>
<br>
A business that is system-centric, rather than owner-centric, is structurally ready to be sold. In other words, the successful day-to-day operation of the business is not dependent on you, the owner. Because you are not the &quot;special sauce,&quot; potential buyers (or inheritors) do not need to be concerned that the business will fall apart once you leave.<br>
<br>
A system-centric business is well-positioned to sell for the present value of the future free cash flows, plus a premium...

    If you own a business, you need to act like you are a business owner and chief executive officer, not like a manager or glorified employee.<br>
<br>
A CEO's job is to design, grow and lead the business. A manager's job is to implement the CEO's strategy, drive efficiency, and otherwise improve the business. An employee's job is to operate the business.<br>
<br>
You should view your business as a cash-flow generating asset that works independently of you. In other words, it is system-centric rather than you-centric. If you want your business to grow, it should be professionally managed just like any asset...

    Becoming the chief executive officer of your company starts with slowing down, reflecting and adopting a new way to look at your business. Someone has to be the CEO; it might as well be you.<br>
<br>
If a business does not have executive leadership, its productivity is pretty much guaranteed to be stifled. So, be open-minded. All meaningful progress is the result of change. Change your habits, change your life.<br>
<br>
Changing your habits begins with understanding what you want (business success, freedom, etc.) and then changing your mindset to achieve your goals.<br>
<br>

    Are you a prisoner to your business? As a business owner, can you leave your business for one to two months and come back to find it operating smoothly and profitably?<br>
<br>
Can you leave your business for even a two-week, work-free vacation? If not, you don't own a business; you own a glorified job.<br>
<br>
You do not have an effective business system; you are the business system.<br>
<br>
In this column we will discuss in detail what causes people to become a prisoner of their business and how to break free...

<p class=" ''">
    If you are like many entrepreneurs, in as few as two to three years, regardless of the financial success you have achieved, your dream of freedom, independence and wealth has begun to turn into something of a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Instead of being the master of your destiny, you have become a prisoner to your business.<br>
<br>
You may have tried working harder, believing that someday you will get caught up, your life will slow down and you will finally have more free time. What you have found is that the 60- to 70-hour workweeks continue, you still cannot escape for a few relaxing no-work days and your headaches continue.<br>
<br>
Why is your experience different from what you expected...?

    Yesterday, my family and I drove by a now-closed butcher shop where we would often go to get meat and cheese for special occasions. My wife commented on the demise of the store and she wondered whether a butcher shop could ever be successful outside of a supermarket. My answer was an emphatic &#x201c;YES!&#x201d; Ultimately, the problem is that being an excellent butcher does not in itself qualify someone to run a butcher shop. The same is true for any business: Technical knowledge alone (being a successful lawyer, doctor, plumber, graphic designer, engineer, etc.) is not enough to run a business...

    In general, there are three ways a company can compete: price, product/service and customer experience. Competing on price can be tough on the bottom line, but for companies that do it well (WalMart), it can lead to great financial success. Competing on the quality of our product and service is necessary, but it can be difficult for us to educate the marketplace on why ours is superior (e.g. financial services). The customer experience, however, is something that we can make uniquely ours. Think about how often you chose to do business &#x2013; or not do business &#x2013; with a vendor because of your experience with that company. Personally, customer experience is the reason why I exclusively fly Southwest Airlines.<br>

How does a company deliver excellent, sustainable customer experience...?

    I was sitting in a briefing a few days ago at a Department of Defense facility, and one of the surprising things we were told is that &#x201c;safety is our first priority.&#x201d; Really? Obviously that can&#x2019;t be true in the DOD (&#x201c;Yes, we lost to the enemy, but look how safe we were!&#x201d;).<br>
<br>
The DOD&#x2019;s first priority must be to successfully defend protected assets and win wars. Whereas certainly safety was of critical importance to us on our submarine, I&#x2019;m pretty sure the Navy didn&#x2019;t want us to turn tail and run during a war because incoming enemy torpedoes would adversely affect our safety. The nation&#x2019;s highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, is not awarded for being the safest person in the military &#x2013; it&#x2019;s usually awarded to someone who acts in a decidedly unsafe manner.  You can see this same problem in vision statements&#x2026;

    One of my favorite leadership development practices is to listen to interviews of successful leaders, so naturally I jumped at the opportunity to listen to Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz speak at the Capital Hilton. The Greater Washington Board of Trade&#x2019;s Jim Dineger asked Schultz questions based on his new book &#x2013; &quot;Onward&quot; &#x2013; and he also asked him some excellent questions submitted by the audience. Some important points I got were:<br>

    Over the last few months, I wrote about the competition between Facebook and Google and another battle in that competition was announced when Google announced its new +1 social product.

    I've written before that your first priority in marketing is to hold on to your existing customers. Small businesses often satisfy this requirement through exceptional customer service, but many larger companies do it by sorting their customers into tiers (e.g. Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, etc.). The problem with very large companies is that if you fall into one of the lower tiers, you might not be pleased with your experience. For example, United Airlines' customer service problems were made legendary by Dave Carroll in his &quot;United Breaks Guitars&quot; videos.<br>
<br>
I don&#x2019;t mean to pick on large companies. On the contrary, the large company practice of having tiers of customer support is critical for growing, thriving businesses....

    Well, after blogging about business news items for years, it&#x2019;s great to finally blog on an article where I was one of the featured &#x201c;experts&#x201d; (I use that term loosely, of course!). The writer, Anne Field, called me a few weeks ago to ask me about common roadblocks that prevent businesses from taking their businesses to the next level. The list can be pretty long, so we limited it to a top 3 so that she could get the article in under her word limit.<br>

    Over the past few weeks, I was a judge for a couple of business plan competitions. One was the Business Professionals of America&#xe2;&#x80;&#x99;s National Leadership Conference and the other was the Community Business Partnership&#xe2;&#x80;&#x99;s 2011 Business Plan competition. I saw many great business ideas, but I also saw the same problem in every single plan except one: the company will be run by Superman and the owner will never die.<br>
<br>
1. Superman. This is the owner who will do everything. Generically speaking...

    Last week there was a little brouhaha over at Amazon.com related to their promotion of Lady Gaga&#x2019;s &#x201c;Born This Way&#x201d; album. On May 23, Amazon offered a digital copy of the album for 99 cents (it wholesales for about $9 &#x2013; Amazon might have paid $7), which led to a massive crush of customers at the Internet retailer&#x2019;s website.<br>
<br>
The traffic caused delays for some customers and drove some other customers away. OK, don&#x2019;t tell anyone, but when I heard about the problems Amazon was having, I decided to head over there (when they repeated the deal) and see if the problem was still there. Everything worked smoothly, I plunked down the 99 cents, and I now have my Lady Gaga music (which I haven&#x2019;t listened to yet).<br>
<br>
Besides giving you a false impression of my musical preferences, there are three great takeaways for us as business leaders:...

    Probably one of the best leadership skills I learned as a nuclear submarine officer in the US Navy was delegation. Would you believe that on a nuclear submarine, the captain is involved in very little of the day-to-day activities? I know movies make it seem like the captain does everything, but that&#x2019;s not the case. Even though he is 100 percent accountable for the ship &#x2013; including the crew, the nuclear reactor and the nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles if it&#x2019;s a boomer &#x2013; he doesn&#x2019;t work 24x7x365. Given the fact that when a submarine screws up, people can die, international incidents can be created, or the captain can get fired, you would think that the captain would never delegate anything but the simplest tasks.<br>
<br>
So how does the captain of a nuclear submarine successfully delegate so much of the day-to-day operation of the ship?<br>

    Those of us who live in the D.C. area were not surprised by the news that came out recently about the Senate Armed Services Committee making some big modifications to two large Lockheed Martin programs. In my 10 years as a defense contractor, I saw this happen all the time. One company I worked for even moved to a larger office in Rosslyn because of the huge influx of employees we had, only to see the program eliminated because new leadership in the directorate decided to use the money in a different way. We tried to find new work for those software engineers, but ultimately&#x2026;<br>

<p class=" ''">
    You may have caught one of the latest set of Verizon Wireless commercials that claim &#x201c;The small business with the best technology rules.&#x201d; Personally, I love the ad with Susie, but I have a BIG issue with the tagline. Sure &#x2013; great technology that is ALSO well implemented can be a great competitive advantage. However, Verizon&#x2019;s tagline is definitely wrong. The small (or large, or mid-size) business with the best LEADERSHIP rules every day of the week and twice on Sunday. In fact, the business with the best leadership and the worst technology is going to run circles around Susie and all her cool technology.<br>

    Several months ago, I met Cary Hatch, CEO of MDB Communications, in the green room of Executive Leaders Radio. Her story impressed me so much that I asked her if she would be willing to speak at the National Capital Region Entrepreneurs Club, and she graciously accepted (She calls talking to groups <br>
like ours her &quot;therapy.&quot;).<br>
<br>
A few takeaways I got from her interview on ELR and her talk at the Entrepreneur's Club:<br>

    Shortly after the news broke that the U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama Bin Laden, an idea struck me while I was out for a run. I was wearing the shirt that honors one of my Naval Academy roommates &#x2014; the late John Kainer &#x2014; and it occurred to me that many business leaders would benefit greatly from learning why the SEALs are so good at what they do.<br>
<br>
So, I started calling around to my friends and classmates who are &#x2014; or were &#x2014; SEALs, and I got a great deal of interest to help me put the article together.<br>

    My last piece about Navy SEAL training and business received so many great comments from people with special operations experience that I decided to modify my plan a little and share these with you. Below are some great items to amplify the list of SEAL leadership wisdom that I wrote about in the first post (Teamwork is paramount, Training, Innovation, and Failure is an option). I am only planning on adding &#x201c;Focus on mission&#x201d; to my original list, but we&#x2019;ll see how things go after I get comments back.<br>

    If you are active in the entrepreneurial or venture capital communities here in D.C., you have undoubtedly heard of Tien Wong, currently the chairman and CEO of Lore Systems. If you haven&#x2019;t heard of Tien, here&#x2019;s a brief summary:<br>
<br>
&#x2014; In 1991, he co-founded and served as CEO of CyberRep, Inc. and grew it to 2300 employees and $80M in revenue before it was acquired in 2003.<br>
<br>
&#x2014; He was the recipient of the 2001 Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for Greater Washington<br>
<br>
&#x2014; He serves or has served on boards of organizations such as the Association for Corporate Growth &#x2013; National Capital, the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland&#x2019;s Robert H. Smith School of Business (the best business school in the world &#x2013; at least in my opinion!), and the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, to name a few.<br>

I invited Tien to speak at the National Capital Region Entrepreneurs Club September luncheon and in case you didn&#x2019;t feel like showing up, here are some of the things he shared with us:<br>

    Back in 1995, I had the good fortune of spending four hours alone with America&#x2019;s first man in space: Rear Admiral Alan Shepherd. I walked into the office of one of my bosses, Jack Lengyel, who was the athletic director at the Naval Academy at the time, to ask him permission to hold my wedding reception in the &#x201c;N-Room&#x201d; at Hubbard Hall. The encounter was a bit awkward, because he assumed I was coming to ask him for his car so that I could pick up Shepherd in style at the Key Bridge Marriott. I left his office with the keys to the N-Room and the keys to Jack&#x2019;s car, so I picked up Shepherd (in style) and drove him to the Naval Academy, where he was going to do a signing for his book &quot;Moon Shot.&quot; <br>

    The Navy SEALs are run by great leaders. And the SEALs are the best at what they do because they are a team &#x2013; not a bunch of incredibly well trained men who only follow the micromanaging orders of the person in charge.  As an illustration, consider a football team. The quarterback on a football team doesn&#x2019;t micromanage the offense; each player on a championship football team knows his job, knows how to adjust as the defense adjusts, knows how to react when the play unfolds, and understands how critical his job is to mission accomplishment. It is the quarterback who calls the play, gives the orders to start (calls the cadence), and has the most strategic view of everyone on the offense on how to accomplish their part of the mission.<br>

    When I ask business leaders what it means to have a strategy-driven business, or what it means to be a strategic business owner, I mostly get responses that it&#x2019;s nice to have a strategy, but it&#x2019;s not really that important. My observation is that this is driven by their past attempts to create and implement strategies. Since those attempts almost always fail to make any impact on their business, they give it up as some kind of academic exercise that is irrelevant in the real world. This is a mistake, because strategy-driven businesses perform better than their peers, and a great local example of that comes from Jim Garland of Sharp Details Inc.<br>

    One of the biggest challenges facing most small tech companies is the inability to take their eyes off of their technology long enough to focus on the marketplace. &#x201c;If we build it, they will come&#x201d; works for Kevin Costner, but for the rest of us it can lead to great deal of disappointing business performance.<br>
<br>
The problem is that even though we might know a great deal about our technology, we simply don&#x2019;t know as much as we think we do about our marketplace.<br>

    After making some modifications to our home security system in 2011, our monthly fee went from about $25 a month to about $38. After paying that fee consistently for over a year, my most recent automatic payment was over 50 percent higher, an unexpected &#x2013; and unexplained &#x2013; increase. Around the same time, I had stopped receiving e-mail notifications that my alarm was armed, disarmed, etc.<br>
<br>
I contacted the vendor to get the details, and a friendly woman &#x2013; named Emily &#x2013; called me within 24 hours to follow up with me. Emily told me that the company had recently conducted an audit of their accounts, and it turned out that I should not have been receiving the Internet-based service, so they just decided to remove it from my account without notifying me. <br>

<p class=" ''">
    I decided to build on my recent technology marketing post by asking the speaker for next week&#x2019;s National Capital Region Entrepreneurs Forum &#x2013; Mark Dumas &#x2013; if he had any pearls of wisdom that he wanted to share with tech entrepreneurs/CEOs.<br>
<br>
A little about Mark: He started SPADAC Inc.    in 2002 and sold it for $46 million eight years later to GeoEye Inc. Now known as GeoEye Analytics Inc., the McLean-based company provides advanced geospatial intelligence, analytic services, research and development, spatial content management and predictive analysis.<br>
<br>
The theme of our conversation was: Be really judicious with your overhead...<br>

    Last year, I responded to a Groupon promotion for a cool-looking portable audio device called Rock-It. This little speaker was definitely as cool as it looked, but I unfortunately broke it during a business trip last November. Since the warranty expired, I sent a request through the company&#x2019;s website to see if it was possible to get it repaired. Mike Szymczak, the co-founder of the company, replied back and told me that he&#x2019;ll just send me a new one.<br>
<br>
I was really surprised by that response. After all, the warranty had expired, and since OrigAudio sells innovative and inexpensive consumer audio electronics, providing me with an outstanding customer experience was unlikely to lead to high-volume, repeat business.<br>

<p class=" ''">
    One of the toughest questions a technology company owner &#x2013; or any company owner &#x2013; has to ask is: When should I hire contractors or consultants to do a job (outsourcing) and when should I hire someone for the job internally (an employee).<br>
<br>
In an article about the U.S. Small Business Administration&#x2019;s Maryland Small Business Person of the Year, Software Consortium CEO Janet Amirault states that replacing contractors with full-time employees helped her grow the strong team she needed.<br>
<br>
This makes sense. An axiom I learned in both academia and business is....

    Take heed what ye say of your seniors / Be your words spoken softly or plain / Lest a bird of the air tell the matter / And so ye shall hear it again.<br>
<br>
-- From &#x201c;The Laws of the Navy&#x201d;<br>
<br>
Although third stanza from &#x201c;The Laws of the Navy&#x201d; refers to one&#x2019;s seniors, I&#x2019;ve used it since leaving active duty as a guideline for managing customer relationships, business relationships, etc. (just replace the word &#x201c;seniors&#x201d; with &#x201c;customers&#x201d; or &#x201c;colleagues&#x201d;). When I forgot this advice, invariably I would pay for it one way or another. Another way to think about is to consider how your actions or words would look if they were printed on the front page of The Washington Post, or if they appeared in the top 10 Yahoo! Trending Topics of the day.<br>

    A few weeks ago, I wrote about Mark Dumas&#x2019; advice regarding outsourcing research and development . One of the ways he said that this helps a company is by fostering innovation. Bringing in people who are not constrained by the solution biases that exist in any organization (yes, including yours) can yield creative, elegant solutions to big challenges.<br>
<br>
My observation is that many technology companies do all of their R&amp;D in house (take my poll and let me know how you handle R&amp;D ), so they&#x2019;re probably missing out on some great breakthroughs as a result.<br>

    For good reason, we celebrate the cool technology companies. Some of my local favorites were (and are): AOL, MicroStrategy Inc. and LivingSocial Inc.<br>
<br>
What also pumps me up, though, are successful, traditional companies (law firms, accounting firms, plumbers and insurance agents). The reason is that &#x2013; for them &#x2013; differentiation, employee retention, continuous growth, etc., takes exceptional leadership talent and creativity. The practical experience of the leaders of these businesses is something that can directly help us transform our own companies.

    Mark Twain once said &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t what you don&#x2019;t know that gets you into trouble. It&#x2019;s what you know for sure that just ain&#x2019;t so.&quot;<br>
<br>
I recently had the great honor of observing the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Naval War of 1812 Walking Tour &amp; Exhibit at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. The Governor of Maryland and the Mayor of Annapolis were both on hand to give speeches and participate in the ceremony. My colleague, Navy Capt. Victor Delano (ret), and I hung around Mahan Hall for about an hour or so afterwards to chat and check out some of the artifacts...<br>
<br>
...OK, I admit that Vic and me hanging around together is not that interesting to you, but what&#x2019;s missing to you is what you don&#x2019;t know...

    Ever hear the story of the guy whose career was ruined by him having sex with someone he wasn't supposed to? Someone like a subordinate at work, a prostitute, or anyone besides his wife (if he's married)? Of course you have. Just a few days ago, the captain of the nuclear submarine U.S.S. Pittsburgh (SSN-720) was relieved of his command one week after taking over. The reason? The married father of two &#x2014; Commander Michael P. Ward II &#x2014; allegedly faked his death to get out of a relationship with a woman 20 years younger than him.<br>

If schadenfreude is generally your first reaction to stories like this, you should keep in mind...<br>

    A few weeks ago, my wife and I took our kids to one of my favorite places to visit in the summer &#x2014; a water park. In this case, it was Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in New Jersey. We had to find a few rides that my youngest &#x2013; 5-year old Ted &#x2013; could go on, and without too much trouble, we found the perfect one: Hurricane Mountain. With six slides and a capacity of 960 riders per hour, we were guaranteed a swiftly moving line. When we got there, the &#x201c;outside&#x201d; line was only about 8 deep, and the waiting time at the &#x201c;inner&#x201d; line was reported as 10 minutes. So, we got in line and waited.<br>
<br>
And waited. And waited. And waited.<br>

    In honor of the bicentennial of the War of 1812, I wear a special 2-flag lapel pin. On the left-hand side is the U.S. flag and on the right is Oliver Hazard Perry&#x2019;s iconic battle flag from the War of 1812 : &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Give Up the Ship.&#x201d; The flag holds a place of honor at the Naval Academy. A replica hangs on the wall in Memorial Hall, right over the list of our alumni who were killed in action (see the picture close by). The original is in our museum. Perry had the flag made in honor of his friend Captain James Lawrence, who said the words after he was mortally wounded in battle onboard the USS Chesapeake in 1813.<br>

Victory at all costs may be critical in war...

    I asked Art Medici, a partner at Newport Board Group, what was the biggest mistake CEOs routinely make. Given Art&#x2019;s extensive CEO pedigree (he&#x2019;s raised money, right-sized, navigated through mergers and acquisitions, founded companies, turned companies around, etc.), I figured he was the right guy to ask. He answered, but along the way he also gave me a bunch of other wisdom. Here are some highlights:

    I had the great fortune of getting to know a local business legend &#x2014; Alan Peyser &#x2014; over the past few weeks. Alan helped found a company in 1975 that was eventually acquired by Cable &amp; Wireless. As president and CEO of the new venture, he grew it from $6 million in 1980 to $1.1 billion in 1995. I learned a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of wisdom by talking with him and trading e-mails over the last few weeks &#x2013; especially when it comes to customer service and hiring great people. I don&#x2019;t have the space to write down even half of what he shared with me, but one of the coolest things he gave me was his list of Ground Rules that helped him achieve such great business success:

    When I was a submarine officer on the USS Philadelphia, we had a technical problem occur while we were on a mission &#x2013; a problem that caused us more than a little bit of concern.<br>
<br>
If we replaced the component that failed, it would require us leaving our station and immediately conducting integration testing. Unfortunately, leaving the station was not an acceptable option, given the fact that we were on a mission of great importance to national security. Moreover, operating with the failed component was extremely impractical for a number of reasons, so we were in desperate need to come up with an innovative solution.<br>

John was CEO of the company for almost 30 years before selling it to Nestl&#xe9;, and although he can&#x2019;t share any details, he will say that the water bottler and refreshment company did well in the sale. His successful exit was fueled by some very impressive performance for his industry:<br>

    In the military, there&#x2019;s a term for forces that operate without a strategy &#x2014; &quot;losers of battles.&quot; Obviously, if a general doesn&#x2019;t know the overall objective &#x2013; the mission &#x2013; he can&#x2019;t tactically deploy his forces. Moreover, if he doesn&#x2019;t have a top-level plan for achieving each goal, he&#x2019;s going to make it very difficult for his resources to accomplish the mission. Think about it: what if Eisenhower&#x2019;s D-Day planning just stopped with &quot;converge the allies on Berlin,&quot; or if the Apollo missions were simply, &quot;Let&#x2019;s just get guys out in space and let them do cool things&quot;?<br>

    A few months ago, I had the great honor of sitting next to Daniel Akerson, the CEO of General Motors, at a dinner honoring Naval Academy Distinguished Graduate Award winners. Akerson, a 1970 graduate of my alma mater, was awarded the honor himself in 2012.<br>
<br>
After a brief conversation ranging from Navy football to leadership, we both agreed that there is a big need for the kind of leaders that the service academies produce in the marketplace. It&#x2019;s that leadership gap that prompted me to start my business in the first place.<br>

    Dan Akerson is not running for class president. The General Motors CEO is not trying to win a popularity contest.<br>
<br>
&#x201c;I needed to communicate &#x2014; with passion &#x2014; what was good for the company, and that wasn&#x2019;t always going to sit well. I had a responsibility to employees, shareholders and taxpayers. I had a patriotic duty to rebuild this company.&#x201d;<br>

    With such an obvious focus on leadership and culture, I asked General Motors CEO Dan Akerson what the characteristics of great leaders are. Without even pausing to think, he said, &#x201c;competence, integrity, and passion.&#x201d;<br>
<br>
Competence is pretty clear &#x2014; an incompetent manager cannot lead his people. Without integrity, a manager will lose the trust of her people and eventually lose her best people. And passion is what differentiates good leaders from great leaders.<br>

    One of the difficult things for Dan Akerson to get his arms around when he took over at General Motors as CEO was the &#x201c;rallying point.&#x201d; When he was at MCI, AT&amp;T was the clear rallying point. AT&amp;T was trying to keep MCI out of the long-distance business, so MCI needed to fight back at every turn.<br>
<br>
It turned out that GM&#x2019;s biggest adversary was itself, or &#x2014; as it is often referred to in the company today &#x2014; &#x201c;old GM.&#x201d; GM caused its own demise, so fixing it required &#x201c;staring into the abyss, coming to terms with what went wrong, and getting a handle on all the things that they could control.&#x201d;<br>

    As I mentioned in Part 1 of this series, mediocrity is constantly trying to infiltrate every organization, and world-class leaders work relentlessly to keep mediocrity out. When I asked Nick Saban, the head coach of the University of Alabama&#x2019;s football team, how he is able to consistently win in the competitive sport that is college football, he shared with me eight points. Here are five:<br>
<br>
1. You have to be willing to serve. Great leaders are great servers. Every time I hear the term &#x201c;servant leader,&#x201d; I always think, &#x201c;Well that&#x2019;s redundant. Is there any other kind of leader?&#x201d;<br>

In Part 2, I listed five of the eight points that he shared with me about leadership. Here are the final three points we discussed:<br>
<br>
1. You can&#x2019;t make people do things. When I asked him about managing people, Saban said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you can manage people, Ingar. You can&#x2019;t...<br>
