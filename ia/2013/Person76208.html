<p class=" description summary">
    My vocational background is varied and broad based. I have been in Fundraising, Law Enforcement, Coaching, Sales &amp; Marketing, Promotional Consulting, Customer Service and Construction Consulting. I have overseen construction projects in the millions of dollars within the residential home building market along with construction management in apartment and condominium development. I am a former California licensed General Building and Insulation and Acoustical Contractor. <br>
<br>
My strong athletic background ingrained a hard work ethic and mindset in me. It is coupled with a &#x201c;Do It Now! Do It Right! and Pay Attention To Detail!&#x201d; attitude.  These effective concepts of personal and business development support were developed in me by some truly wonderful and genuinely remarkable human beings. I have taken those enabling life values, virtues and nurturing ideals throughout my various vocational pursuits. What those mentors and developers of character instilled in me, forged those highly regarded traits that reflect in my life today. As such, they have facilitated greater proficiency in aiding to my expertise within the many business models with which I have been affiliated.  <br>
<br>
Business associates have commented that I possess a great ability to build relationships, identify strategic opportunities, along with being an amazing connector of people to advance a certain cause or action item. The terms &quot;go-getter&quot; and &quot;mover and shaker&quot; have also been affixed. <br>
<br>
Something else has also emerged... A truth seeking writer that is unafraid to take a leap of faith and step out to share those great life encounters to aid in another's journey. This is the &#x201c;first step&#x201d; in my measure of &quot;giving back.&quot; Through the many enlightening life experiences I have been blessed to have encountered, what I have learned most is this: <br>
<br>
When you live your life on true purpose and intent, you WILL make the &quot;right&quot; difference in all you do whether you realize it or not! <br>
<br>
Have a GREAT life!

This is a &quot;true life&quot; inspirational journey of a Super Bowl hero son and his father's battles against multiple addictions. The book is co-authored by a bestselling author of more than seventy books, Mike Yorkey, who related to me:<br>
<br>
&quot;Kevin, of all the books I've written about sports, this is by far the best I've done. I couldn't even imagine experiencing the things that Mike and Chris said to me when we were putting the book together. Especially what Mike related about his childhood... I was shocked!&quot;<br>

    I had the pleasure of lending my PR/Marketing support to my &quot;Amigo&quot; - New York Times bestselling author Curt Sampson for his book - The War By The Shore - that was published by Gotham Books and released nationwide on 9-6-12. The paperback released on August 6, 2013.<br>
<br>
I was fortunate to have secured this major endorsement for Curt:<br>
<br>
&#x201c;Curt Sampson has written another great book about golf. 'The War by the Shore' tells the story of the 1991 Ryder Cup in all its glory. A fantastic story and a riveting read.&#x201d; Donald J.Trump<br>
<br>
In The War By The Shore, Curt depicts the dramatic events from the 1991 Ryder Cup. These intense matches played out on the famed Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. Consequently, the 2012 PGA Championship was played at Kiawah and later, the 2012 Ryder Cup matches were played at famed Medinah CC in Chicago. <br>
<br>
About Curt's book:<br>
 <br>
The 1991 Ryder Cup epic journey and tale really began in 1985. At that point, Team Europe wrested a victory away from Team USA for the first time in years in this biannual match-up of golf professionals representing the US/Europe. Following another European victory in 1987 and a draw in 1989 - in 1991, the US team was ready to win.<br>
<br>
The 1991 Ryder Cup also occurred during a time of heightened patriotism in the United States as the country was emerging victorious in the Persian Gulf War and the Cold War. During the match, fans forgot golf's gentlemanly code of conduct. Loud boos, jeers and cheers of &quot;USA!&quot; could be heard from the gallery and it quickly became evident that this match was about more than just golf.<br>
<br>
In The War By The Shore, Curt chronicles this pivotal competition. He interviewed dozens of key players from both teams and provides historical context to explain why the tension was so high at this particular Ryder Cup venue.<br>

    Dreams are great! We all need them. One Ray of Hope Productions is another evolving venture with PROCON-PRESS that also focuses on inspirational and motivational content productions. These positively life-changing products are designed for one purpose only &#x2014; to inspire and motivate the spirit within the human element to do great things first &#x2014; for another. <br>
<br>
Whether by commercials, radio, television or animated and live-action motion pictures &#x2014; One Ray of Hope &#x2014; will raise the bar for others to follow to make the right difference in this world. Movies already in the &#x201c;dream-works&#x201d; developmental stage are &#x2014; Recovery Of A Lifetime, The Long White Line, The Shadow Taker and A Beautiful History.<br>
<br>
I continue to seek finishing funds for an epic motion picture depicting the life story of Mother Teresa called &quot;The LETTERS.&quot; It stars two-time Oscar nominated acting legend Max von Sydow, Blade Runner and The Hitcher's -- Rutger Hauer, along with acclaimed award winning English actress, Juliet Stevenson as Mother Teresa. Cast and film crew completed principal photography in Goa, India in 2012. Post-production nears completion with scheduled private screenings to follow. To view some early footage, visit www.cinemawestfilms.com.  <br>
<br>
Also slated, is a made for television/DVD movie based on the inspirational true story &quot;One Small Sparrow&quot; written by Jeff Leeland. It surrounds his family's personal encounter with his young 18-month old son Michael's near fatal battle with childhood leukemia. This bestselling book was endorsed by Leeza Gibbons with supporting book foreword jointly written by former baseball pitcher Dave Dravecky and College Football Hall of Fame inductee and legendary University of Washington head football coach, Don James.

<p class=" description past-position">
    I will continue to support the diligent efforts made by the Independent Retired National Football League Football Players in their quest for fairness and restitution for out of pocket expenses personally incurred from inadequate and negligible support from the National Football League. My contemporaries have painstakingly earned the right to receive their disability and/or retirement payments which so many have not yet received. <br>
<br>
There will always be a niche to write about something in the sports world. I would love to collaborate with other writers who are most aware of this plight faced by these former gridiron &quot;old-school&quot; gladiators. I envision a book appropriately titled: &quot;Carnage on the Gridiron--The NFL's Meat Jungle.&quot; <br>
<br>
This was from a question asked of Mike Taylor, the Pittsburgh Steelers1968, 1st round draft pick:<br>
<br>
&quot;If you spend enough time reading various publications or blogs regarding the physical, mental and emotional hardships suffered by my contemporaries, it's shocking and heartbreaking to learn about what they are facing in their after life years away from a game they loved. That being said, I&#x2019;m happy that the NFL and the NFLPA have taken the positive steps they have over the last few years and implemented the Legacy Fund, the &#x201c;88 Plan&#x201d; named for John Mackey and the Long Term Disability plan as well.<br>
<br>
The NFL still needs to step it up and further compensate those whose lives have been greatly impacted from playing in the NFL. Understanding arguments from both sides of the table and working through them will take time. If it weren't for the players on the field filling the seats on game day, there wouldn't be billionaires owning NFL franchises today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hopefully, Mike's words and those found on my former college training partner's website www.davepear.com  will continue to send an even stronger message to the owners and NFLPA union management of the NFL. It's time for some serious realignment Roger Goddell. <br>
<br>
Let the games begin!!

    Eric Johnson, the owner and publisher of ALIVE Magazine in Danville, CA. has granted me a platform to submit my short stories and articles for publication in his San Francisco/East Bay based monthly periodical . It&#x2019;s great to have been embraced for my writer's craft and to have also received his character endorsing comments:<br>
<br>
&#x201c;I met Kevin on only one occasion, but liked him right off. First impressions do count--you can tell something about a man by looking him in the eye and shaking hands. I have since had the opportunity to get to know Kevin better. He knows what he wants and is unafraid to pursue his dreams. That alone sets him apart. He is creative and passionate about his endeavors.&#x201d;

    A few months prior to becoming the National Vice-President West Coast for the Roughnecks Motorcycle Club -- I encouraged the membership to become part of this great group of patriotic supporters. The Patriot Guard Riders are a very special breed of human beings that always go the extra mile to ensure the rightful, earned honor for those who have fought to maintain our freedoms and that they receive the proper support of a grateful nation,<br>
<br>
The Patriot Guard stands in dedicated support for those who will soon deploy to a foreign land or return with &quot;a hero's welcome and praise,&quot; and receiving heartfelt handshakes, hugs and respectfully earned pats on the back from a grateful nation with high praise for a job well done .<br>
<br>
The Patriot Guard also stands in reverent support, bearing colors to solemnly honor the courageous effort exhibited for those who paid the ultimate price to secure What Matters Most! in our lives -- our freedom. <br>
<br>
As a note -- my wife and I had the honor and privilege of welcoming home an individual who was overwhelmed by the support he had received upon returning home. Bobby attentively, and respectfully focused into the eyes of each person and shook their hand in thanks for offering him such an honorable welcome home celebration.  <br>
<br>
Later that evening, he would learn that his father had passed away only two days earlier. It was bitter-sweet for my new friend Bobby, but that small measure of support that was extended by us that day at the airport has helped him weather the emotional loss of his father. <br>
<br>
You want to make the &quot;right&quot; difference for those who defend your freedom as a choice to serve and not one inducted by government order to stand in the defense of our country? Be part of the Patriot Guard and touch another's heart. It will change their life forever. Semper Fi!!

    From the first time I twisted the trottle on a v-twin, I've had an affinity for finding that winding black ribbon of asphalt and chasing the long white line to feel the wind in my face and let it all go. <br>
<br>
Riding the Pacific Coast Highway to the beaches of Southern California, or the California Valley through Yosemite and the Gold Country to the Sierra Nevadas and Lake Tahoe, always makes me feel and appreciate God's great handywork. <br>
<br>
Get your face in the wind and you'll see what I mean! Keep the rubber on the road, the sun at your back and the shiny side up! <br>
<br>
Live to Ride -- Ride to Live; as you focus on What Matters Most! which is in your heart; love first.....Now you know why a dog is happiest when its face is in the wind!

<p class=" description past-position">
    I completed my collegiate football career in 1976 as the starting left defensive tackle and back-up long snapper at the University of Washington. <br>
<br>
Academically, I enjoyed the liberal arts; specifically those areas of communication, philosophy, sociology; but most interestingly enough -- English literature and creative writing. That was a curious knock on the door long ago that I should have been more attentive to with its subtle calling.<br>
My senior year, I finally settled on Speech Communication. I was a talker! Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen, difficult experiences arriving, I didn't earn my degree. Those upending events have spawned that sequestered writer in me to appear. I am excited about the process!   <br>
<br>
Writing has a deeply cleansing and spiritual way of healing one's broken heart and soul from living with the shattered pieces of what was once a childhood dream. I feel as if I have been granted a &quot;second chance&quot; at life from the many revelations that have appeared through this committed writing process. It is truly amazing what appears when you allow yourself to stretch and grow in utilizing your past as a spring board for future success. <br>
<br>
It's so great to finally realize your intended life's path, even if it is so far removed from a place in time when you felt that you had secured that affirming approval from your life's prior hard work. Back then, those dreams seemed little more than delusions of grandeur or some grandiose pipe dream never to be realized. Not any more, especially when you follow your light. Thank you Rambo's Father!<br>
<br>
The greatest memories of any life lessons I have ever known have been these grand encounters and fruitful experiences -- which are far greater than any classroom setting could ever teach! The truth be told, I was never one to let my studies interfere with my education. The writing has enlightened me as to why, when I went about gathering the materials for the bridge I have since built to cross over that earlier wall.

    The wonderful experiences that I shared with my brother Fiji's remain among some of the greatest of my life. I was fortunate to follow behind some great Sigma Tau brothers: Stu Evey, the founding Chairman of the Board of ESPN. Mike Kirkland, a founding member of The Brother's Four folk group. Ron Crockett who became a legendary benefactor to the UW -- second only to Bill Gates. <br>
<br>
It was an honor to have been selected to the All-Fiji football team nationwide for 1975-76. I shared that honor with Ted Albrecht who became the Chicago Bear's 1st round pick in 1977 coming out of the University of California Berkeley. Heisman Trophy Winner John Cappeletti from Penn State, was a member of the All-Fiji football team the year before in1974.<br>
<br>
Other FIJI fraternal associations include Phil Knight -- the founder of Nike. Jack Nicklaus and current PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. Reaching back in history, United States President Calvin Coolidge from Amherst and another who I greatly admired for his great personality and flashy sporting attire, was one who was taken long before his time in a privately chartered jet disaster with others while en-route to the PGA Tour's season ending Tour Championship after winning the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 1999 -- Payne Stewart. God speed Payne.

<p class=" description past-position">
    When I began to reflect on my life's past events, I came to discover from my years of experiences that I had encountered some amazing life shaping and character building traits struck from my own set of trials and tribulations. Ultimately, they shaped and developed my personal skill set. Clay in divine hands I suppose. If something unnerving and shattering had happened, it felt as if I was its unsuspecting student. &quot;Life Skills Coach&quot; seems an appropriate identifier.<br>
<br>
During that revealing reflective glance into my life&#x2019;s rear view mirror of past events, I had noticed that friends from my early days would approach me when their world was a bit grayer. When those darker thoughts would invade their sacred space; somehow, some way, I was able to become a spark of healing support and encouragement that facilitated a move forward with a newer perspective and perception in coping with their life's challenges.<br>
<br>
When moving into this new chapter of my life, I have made an even stronger effort to connect with the human element at the deepest possible level. That necessary level of infusing heart in all that I do on a daily basis. I have been immeasurably blessed to have known and continue to befriend some of the most amazing people on the planet. Good, wholesome, salt of the earth folks. The kind that you can call day or night and they &quot;listen&quot; to your heart. I have discovered that it all comes down to one thing...<br>
<br>
The key to a person is their heart. If you can show a person the key to their heart; you will unlock their individual-personal success. That key... is LOVE!<br>
<br>
My daily goal is to share my heart first so others will come to know that true Light of God's unconditional love in their own world and facilitate that wonderful path of success which I refer to as &quot;The Long White Line.&quot; Embrace life! Let its &quot;goodness&quot; fill you up! Live life and embrace its gift at every turn and those grayer, darker days will become that One Ray of Hope for an abundant and enriching LIFE!

    I was recruited by the Editor-in-Chief  of Sonoma Christian Home magazine to be a regularly contributing writer and celebrity interviewer. <br>
<br>
In my closing interview piece for SCH with long time actor Corbin Bernsen in promoting his &quot;25 Hill&quot; film depicting a story about The American Soap Box Derby, I found a picture from a &quot;Psych&quot; episode where Corbin and my friend -- another long time television acting icon and co-starring cast member in &quot;42&quot; about the life of Jackie Robinson -- Max Gail -- made this special spiritual energy between Corbin and me all the better in building that two-part piece. <br>

Here's the link to that special piece: http://sonomachristianhome.com/2012/07/25-hill-%E2%80%93-rolling-on-faith-and-courage/<br>

Kind of cool how God connects the dots! <br>

<p class=" description past-position">
    In February of 1991, I embarked on a journey that I needed to experience. I had been in the residential production home building business as a customer service representative and assistant superintendent when economic conditions created a restructuring and KJR Construction was born. A very wise man had said to me as I embarked on this new vocational journey:<br>
<br>
&quot;Kevin, if you do what others don't want to do, you'll always have work. Everybody is always looking for the quick and easy way of doing things. Anything worth having, you have to work hard for. Carve out a place for yourself that others won't. Take and do work they refuse to do and you'll work when they are out in the cold because they can't find the work that you already have.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was a &#x201c;hands-on&#x201d; perfectionist and paid attention to the slightest of details. When I was a customer service representative, my supervisor continually sent me to unwind disgruntled homeowners that picked things apart because I was &#x201c;pickier&#x201d; than they were! Satisfaction was always resolute and my resume glowed! <br>
<br>
No matter the size or type of job that I had taken on during my sole-proprietor, independent contractor days as a general building, insulation and acoustical contractor &#x2014; who was always doing the best to please my clientele and go the extra mile to over-deliver &#x2014; I never once advertised and during economically stable times, my schedule of work became one of which I could pick and choose and leaving time for that four-letter obsession &#x2014; GOLF!! <br>
<br>
The many hats I wore as a salesman, consultant, designer, estimator, supervisor, carpenter and reluctant therapist; became a very solid foundational base for me to launch from as I moved ahead to oversee multi-million dollar subdivision and apartment/condominium construction projects. Great life lessons; some pretty tough ones, which a classroom doesn't convey. I love &#x201c;old school&#x201d; methods of learning because they teach you the most and create the best in life.

<p class=" description past-position">
    In early September of 2003, a friend approached me about becoming a member in an upstart Law Enforcement/Public Safety motorcycle club. It seemed odd that he approached me since I didn't own a motorcycle at the time. In March of 2004, I became the proud owner of a Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail Classic (FLSTCI) which I customized in creating my grand stress reliever - The Shadow Taker -  that fit my eye and feel. <br>
<br>
Two weeks after I had taken possession of my customized ride, I entered it in a local event and the voting contingency gave me &quot;Best of Show&quot; honors. That was the first &quot;official&quot; motorcycle event I had attended with this new group of Roughnecks which launched some amazing experiences over the following five years.<br>
<br>
From childhood experiences with motorcycle encounters until my first motorcycle in 1977 and my first Harley, a 1982 Sturgis Lowrider - to this new iron steed built from the finest Milwaukee Iron - this passion to twist the throttle and get in the wind, face it and to feel the freedoms of my soul - my passion for writing was fueled by these excursions of shared brotherhood and camaraderie when hitting the black ribbon of asphalt. <br>
<br>
Those experiences from this five year span became a major catalyst for &quot;The Long White Line&quot; that continues taking form as screenplay/novel. This epic tale of brotherhood, life's challenges and the drama from shattered dreams to finding a new life path will become an impactful, live-action motorcycle motion picture. <br>
<br>
These grand reflective remembrances will forever hold a very special place in my heart from these shared events. Some good, some not so good. Life's contrast. It was a great life experience which became a forging process of my precious mettle to meld the words on the page as a great epic motorcycle journey for What Matters Most! I was blessed to have met so many great human beings and to have shared in their happiness and sadness - those many grand experiences that forge and shape legacy friendships.

<p class=" description past-position">
    I graduated from the Sacramento Sheriff&#x2019;s Basic Recruit Academy in 1981, as the best in overall physical agility and awarded The Distinguished Master shooting medal from the department&#x2019;s Range Master as the top marksman in my class. Because I loved punching holes in targets at the range, I earned a position as a member of the Sheriff&#x2019;s Pistol team in 1982-83. <br>
<br>
I served as an On-Call Deputy Sheriff after completing the required Jail Operations training. I was assigned to the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center in Elk Grove, CA. where I worked in every area of the facility from engaging pre-trial detainees and sentenced inmates to maximum security lock up. I supervised honor facility detainees and worked in the booking office, performed transportation duties, along with fill-in stints in the women&#x2019;s facility. <br>
<br>
A media made famous convicted murderer related instances of her partner&#x2019;s crimes to me one day during transport to court. Her reported comments by me and detective follow up facilitated her partner&#x2019;s incarceration on Nevada&#x2019;s death row, ultimately succumbing to medically related issues and escaping the executioner&#x2019;s hand.  <br>
<br>
I earned the endearing moniker of &#x201c;Rio Crash&#x201d; for two bus driving incidents and spent much time donating my off-hours mostly in patrol services and stints in communications. I served as an assistant coach for the Sheriff&#x2019;s football team in 1985. The Pig Bowl football game was an annual event contested between the Sacramento Sheriff&#x2019;s Department and the Sacramento Police Department as a charity event just prior to the Super Bowl. Today it's an event between law enforcement and firefighter personnel called: Guns and Hoses.<br>
<br>
My short-lived experience in law enforcement was an enlightening and event filled training ground to effectively hone my interpersonal communication and human interaction skills. More valuable life lessons from &#x201c;paying attention to the details.&#x201d;

    In the summer of 1975, a few of my Husky DAWG BROTHERS and I, met at &#x2014; what was then Southern Oregon College &#x2014;  to be part of a weeklong Fellowship of Christian Athletes conference. Teammates Mike Baldassin and Mike Rohrbach played linebacker for the Huskies and were the catalyst for this adventure among us four close friends and teammates. Jeff Leeland, who was a defensive back and would come to author a bestselling book titled: One Small Sparrow; about his family&#x2019;s battle with their young son Michael&#x2019;s &#x2014;named after teammates: Rohrbach and Baldassin &#x2014; childhood Leukemia nightmare and how a Seattle community rallied in uplifting support to pay for infant Michael&#x2019;s bone marrow transplant that insurance carriers refused to pay.  <br>
<br>
The four of us participated in this great adventure and shared a grand week of camaraderie with other athletes throughout the Western United States. The very first day of this event, I was honored to have met the legendary Track and Field Coach from UCLA who was one of John Wooden's closest and dearest friends &#x2014; Elvin C. (Ducky) Drake. <br>
<br>
Some rather interesting &quot;supernatural&quot; occurrences arose at this week-long event that have left a deep mark on my heart and served back then as a stepping off platform which sprung forth the original University of Washington football team&#x2019;s FCA Huddle Group &#x2014; one still in effect today. <br>
<br>
Those week-long experiences became legendary times for us legacy friends who've fought the good fight and persevered through life's challenges because we shared a common faith. A faith of COMMITTED-TRUE-BELIEVERS, which began that hot summer week in Ashland, Oregon in 1975. The following year in 1976 became an even greater experience at Point Loma College in San Diego. What great times! What great experiences! I am truly blessed!!

<p class=" description past-position">
    I began my collegiate football career in the fall of 1972. During spring practice in 1973, I tore the medial collateral ligament off the bone of my left knee and red-shirted the following fall. I did so on the wise advice from an early mentor: Forrest Blue, who at the time was the San Francisco 49ers 3-time, All-Pro Center and its1st round draft pick in 1968.<br>
<br>
From my intense training with my former DAWG BROTHER teammate Dave Pear; who eventually became one of the 10 strongest players in the NFL and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers first All-Pro selection in 1978, I attained greater strength and confidence and in the spring of 1975, I was selected as the Most-Improved Defensive Lineman. <br>
<br>
I played for two legendary Husky coaches in Jim Owens and Don &quot;The Dawgfather&quot; James. My defensive line coach was Jim Mora during the last two years of my college career when I started as left defensive tackle in 1975-76 . <br>
<br>
The best I ever faced was Anthony Munoz in our game at USC in 1976, which was Anthony's freshman year. I played against many first round draft picks during my tenured existence in Division 1 major college football, but Anthony was by far and away the most difficult I had ever faced -- even as a freshman. Just a baby in the game. When he entered the game in the fourth quarter I thought:<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this what I'm going to see every time I line up next year in the NFL? Damn!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Simply amazing! What GREAT memories! What an experience!!

<p class=" description past-position">
    When I was a kid growing up, an organization that captured my interest was the Boy Scouts of America. My neighbor next door and two brothers across the street were also involved in the BSA through their respective churches and other organizations. We all became Eagle Scouts. <br>
<br>
I went further, becoming a Brotherhood member within the honored scouting court known as The Order of the Arrow. The lasting memories that still play out in my mind today from those very special and endearing times that my friends and I experienced in our younger days, always lends genuine warmth from these shared grand experiences with those who mattered most in my young life, and some, who have circled back today. <br>
<br>
Back then we had a saying that &quot;Scouting Rounds a Guy Out.&quot; The reinforcing values and virtues I gleaned as a curiously inquiring young lad have always stayed with me throughout the years. It was sacred, hallowed ground of which I was honored to have walked. My short-lived law enforcement career with its own memories of camaraderie and brotherhood pale greatly in comparison to those earlier experiences and memories that remain vivid in my mind. <br>
<br>
The 12 points of the Scout Law: Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent have left their indelible mark on my heart, mind and soul. They were also reinforced by the Scout slogan &#x2014; Do a Good Turn Daily &#x2014; and the Scout motto &#x2014; Be Prepared. <br>
<br>
These were all great qualities that were taught through example of their enabling life's walk. These fostering, nurturing experiences facilitated bonding friendships which have been notably written across my heart and still live in my mind. They will forever be a part of my individual legacy and daily walk of life. <br>
<br>
Thanks to those who took the time to mentor me as a young kid. Thanks also to those who take on this noble, caring and compassionate responsibility today to make the &quot;right&quot; difference in this often times dark world.

    Just as the first afternoon two-a-day session began at the start of my senior year in 1976, one of my teammates, a close personal friend, ran up to me in the locker room excitedly stating:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Guns! Check this out Bro!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What Rohr?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I just heard a pro scout talking about you down by the tunnel!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, so what did he say?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He said that from all of his scouting trips across the country that 'this Richardson kid is the strongest one I've seen!' Way to go Bro!&quot; <br>
<br>
I stood there stunned, quietly elated and realized that my intense training had paid off. I had made a favorable impression on the NFL's head hunters. At that instance, it felt like my dreams were being handed to me on a silver platter.My visions were coming true! <br>
<br>
Five months later, something occurred in my life that changed me forever. Its total impact of cause and effect didn't manifest the true depth of that experience until the writer in me began to emerge as the words spilled onto the page... It's a process.

    In class one day, my high school French teacher said to me: <br>
<br>
&quot;Jean-Claude [we had to pick a French name for class] if you spent as much time on your schoolwork as you do in sports, you would be a straight &quot;A&quot; student!&quot; <br>
<br>
Miss Miller had no idea, nor did anyone else back then that there were underlying physiological aspects related to my Strabismus eyesight with its associative physiological/psychological overlapping major symptoms of ADD that left me feeling bored and behind in my classes and always lost in my daydreams. I always felt as one not being as smart and feeling left behind academically and only getting by. <br>
<br>
As a result, I overcompensated with social activities and sports where my gifted athletic prowess and physical strength allowed me greater self-gratification and self-esteem. From this, I was not one to ever let my studies interfere with my life's education... It's a Process.

I enjoy spending quiet, together time with my wife and our five dogs. I love sitting at my computer's keyboard, feeling that magical release flowing through my fingertips as the words dance and lace in creative prose on the screen in front of me. Listening to music feeds my spirit and watching inspirational and motivational films KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE! I am a big fan of cinematic works developed from Nick Sparks' bestselling novels and the Robert B. Parker - Jesse Stone - teleplay adaptations done by Tom Selleck.

I love reading a new book when the time arrives. I am a passionate networker in developing and creating relationships that benefit the community. To this, when life beckons with its alluring summons, twisting the throttle on my Harley, knocking that little white ball across fairway and green and getting a line wet when that sacred time arrives always nurtures my soul in a very special way. Live LIFE by Living In Faith Everyday!! Find GRACE and walk in its illuminating Light!!          </p>

    So this is that special space designated to boast about all the great accolades one has received along the way by displaying them like a brightly flashing LED light reader board. Or not, from those truly humble folks that live by example first. So I will say that I've received my fair share of awards and trophies traveling life's path &#x2013; maybe not as glowing as some of my old football adversaries and college classmates, but the most important thing that I have come to realize in life is that an &quot;Atta-Boy&quot; - Praise - will do just fine! Why?<br>
<br>
Praise spurs you to dream bigger dreams!! Praise becomes that igniting spark that feeds your Spirit and nurtures your soul, because it inspires your mind and ultimately motivates you to be that encouraging positive Light of true hope in someone else's life! So get out there and create your own awards!! Get off the bench and jump hard into the game of LIFE -- full throttle! Twist it!! It&#x2019;s What Matters Most! Leave a strong legacy! What&#x2019;s yours?!!
