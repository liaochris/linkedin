<p class=" description current-position">
    I am not a web developer or a website designer by any stretch of the imagination, but learning on my own and teaching others is an inherent trait of mine. I always believed JAVA was coffee, and when asked about JAVA my response has always been &#x201c;Black with Sugar&#x201d;. I know enough about HTML to be considered dangerously methodical, because I take the &quot;Old School&quot; approach by developing 1 line of code at a time until I eventually perfect the desired results.<br>
<br>
When I took on the responsibility of the FSOI website, much of the information was old, obsolete, and out dated, while several functions of the website were not functioning correctly. In order to simplify and organize the website I added several pages, as well as several functions and features. One of which, I added the FSOI &#x201c;FAVICON&#x201d;, so now when people add FSOI as a favorite to your favorite website list, the FSOI logo will appear. I also enhanced SEO with many effective keywords, and made the registration process for many of the workshops virtually simplistic and effortless.<br>
<br>
I created a curriculum of workshops relevant to job seekers, and recruited the appropriate facilitator to conduct the workshop. A process that is seemingly endless, while continually rewarding at the same time.

It is my distinct honor and privilege to coach many highly powerful and highly successful individuals who found themselves between positions the ability to network their way to a new position through the use of LinkedIn.<br>
<br>
By dividing the curriculum into 3 sections provided success for those in various stages in their job search.<br>
- LinkedIn for the Beginners User - Passively Build your Profile<br>
- LinkedIn for the Intermediate User - Assertively Build your Network<br>
- LinkedIn for the Advanced User - Aggressively Go for that Job<br>
<br>
Beginner &#x2013; 47% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework.<br>
Intermediate &#x2013; 53% - 54% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework.<br>
Advanced &#x2013; 34% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework. Often with more than one offer.

    It was my distinct honor and privilege to work with some of the most talented professional people that I know, and aid them and myself in obtaining clarity and direction in their job search during this time of economical uncertainty. It was truly an honor and learning experience on nearly every level of my personal and professional life. Each of the people that were in the group taught as well as learned from one another, and it is in this spirit that I sincerely hope that success to continue for each of them as well as myself. I truly hope that our paths will cross again under better circumstances. I made several NEW friends and I find comfort in knowing that I know will help me if they can when the occasion arises, and they in return know that I will help them if I can when the occasion arises.

I was also solely responsible for implementing custom fabrication drawings and customer proposal drawings thus delivering greater communications value between sales, engineering, vendors, manufacturing, and the client. It was also my responsibility to consult with various vendors in order to improve fabrication drawings in order to stream line fabrication process by 150%. I also served as the principal liaison between several key vendors, contractors, and manufacturing. It was also my responsibility to secured and managed several vendor quotes and coordinated vital purchase orders on all principle projects.

As a contingent, I had the rare opportunity to observe the inner workings and interact of the employees of time company, without having to deal with the hindrance of inner office politics.<br>
<br>
For a company that changes its logo almost as often as it changes its CEO this company could have the ability to really be a contender in the world of hand tools, power tools and tool storage, but until it can gain stability amongst its own employee, only its stock holders will gain a write off on their income taxes.<br>

During my short tenure with M&amp;I Industries, my duties and responsibilities included Researching and implementing the best possible method to re-build and/or restore vintage machinery.<br>
<br>
Many of the machines that I restored and/or re-built were commonly originally manufactured by companies that were no longer in existence, and commonly were originally manufactured prior to World War I.<br>
<br>
Commonly, these machines were originally constructed with tighter tolerances, then their modern day equivalent. All of the machines that I re-built were commissioned to M&amp;I, for restoration back to their original specifications.<br>
<br>
Many of the practices that I had to employ preceded such modern day practices such as ASME Y14.5M, and Geometric, Dimensioning &amp; Tolerance (GD&amp;T). Discovering the 19th century equivalence was the biggest challenge that I had to research, and employ during reconstruction.<br>
<br>
The job that I did with M&amp;I was very exciting and challenging, never did I ever considered my job boring, or tedious. There was always something new to learn about how things were (once upon a time) manufactured in this country.<br>
<br>
I would probably still be employed by M&amp;I if it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that they relocated out of state and that at the time I was unable to relocate with them

<br>
When I was hired on at Wilson Doors, from the beginning I knew that it would be a short lived position.<br>
<br>
My primary responsibility was to create ALL standard piece part, weldments, sub-assembly and assembly drawings, since the company (at the time) had absolutely no record of these documents on hand. Apparently, the only person who knew how to make any of these parts (at the time) was the shop foreman.<br>
<br>
Also, while I was there I attempted to implement some quality standards, and some waste management systems, but my ideas were shot down because there was a high re-cycling value on their scrap aluminum. Apparently, they felt that their 30% scrap rating was considered an acceptable loses.<br>
<br>
Consistency was also a project of mine. Insuring that similar and identical doors were constructed in the same manor, thus insuring consistency.<br>
<br>
I was able to initiate the implementation of Geometric, Dimensioning &amp; Tolerance (GD&amp;T) per ASME Y14.5M to a limited extent.<br>
<br>
When my assignment was completed, the value that I added to this company can now be quantifiably measured, and literally taken to the bank.

I was placed at In-Sink-Erator (division of Emerson Electric) through the temp Agency Pollok &amp; Skan. Although my position was considered a temporary position, my valuable knowledge, talent, and skills were always valued and always sought be the entire engineering staff.<br>
<br>
What originally was supposed to be a 6 month assignment ended up to be more than 3&#xbd; years.<br>
<br>
My main duties included maintaining and updating the Master Floor Plan Layout of the entire facility, including the building structure, mechanical, and support systems, thus creating a venue in which to document and track the optimization of the limited square footage of the manufacturing facility and the office operations. This alone took me more than 1 year to reverse engineer and properly document this 900,000 square foot manufacturing facility.<br>
<br>
Another duty that I was entrusted with was to Improve existing methods of Material Handling and Material Flow through the manufacturing facility by re-organizing product WIP (Work In Progress) flow through manufacturing facility by re-organizing and re-positioning placement of capital equipment in order to optimize capital equipment efficiency, and minimize parts (Inventory) in Queue.<br>
<br>
In doing so, a few of my methods included incorporating cellular manufacturing and ergonomics in order to increase productivity and worker health and safety, while providing quick flexibility of product special (Custom) runs.

During my short tenure with Aquatic Technologies, I was called upon to perform all sorts of tasks. <br>
<br>
It was my responsibility to Maintain Design Specifications for all projects (not just mine). In doing so I Incorporate GD&amp;T (ASME Y14.5M) when ever applicable into every design. And since I was the only person at Aquatic Technologies at the time that was familiar with Geometric Dimensioning &amp; Tolerance, I had the distinction of instructing others on the staff.<br>
<br>
It was also possible for me to Enforce Manufacturing Specifications without losing integrity of the product/design while cutting unnecessary cost in the product, process and/or procedures.<br>
The range of projects that that I was involved with often included HVAC Design, Robotics, Electrical Schematics, Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics, Sheet Metal Layout &amp; Design, Power Distribution Schematics, Machine Design, Fixture Design, Tooling Design, Piece Part Documentation, and more.<br>
<br>
It was also my responsibility to communicate and coordinate with various Vendors and every customer on a daily basis or as the situation warranted.

Jones + Attwood, (http://www.glv.com/ja.htm) was the U.S. branch office of the corporate office of the same name, based in the west midlands of England. Manufacturer of Waste Water Treatment equiptment.<br>
<br>
The management style at Jones + Attwood was the most unique I had ever experienced in my career both prior or since. Communication with every employee was priority ONE. The opinions and viewpoints of every employee were valued by all.<br>
<br>
How many companies do you imagine that exist out there that actually have a PUB on the premises. A PUB which is only open to the employees, only for a couple of hours on Friday, after working hours. These were probably the most effective communication meetings I had ever attended. Imagine the comfort of communication with all, while shooting darts, and nursing a cold soda and eating a pizza.<br>
<br>
The time I had with Jones + Attwood I will always consider my most exciting and fulfilling on both a personal level as well as a professional level.<br>
<br>
Although I was originally hired to be a Draftsman, my duties and responsibilities quickly change and evolved.<br>
<br>
It was not uncommon to be working on a drawing one minute, and either loading or unloading a truck the next. One minute I could have been prepping a product for shipment, and the next I could very easily been asked to install an air or water line in the shop, or make a service call in the field.<br>
<br>
The ability of being able to change hats on the fly was not uncommon with Jones + Attwood. In fact those who couldn&#x2019;t adapt often did not last too long with the company.<br>
<br>
Management encouraged every employ to always take the initiative to fix a problem when ever they found one. Employees were often given a semi-free hand to improve what ever they felt needed change and/or improvement.

    I will admit this was a temp job. I knew it going in that there would be no chance of being hired on directly. Supposedly I was filling for a woman who somehow broke her arm, and could not perform her duties and responsibilities as a drafter.<br>
<br>
On my very first day, my supervisor explained to me the situation, that I was a temp, and there was nowhere in their organization to hire me on direct. He then proceeded to show me the 2-year back log of drawings that needed to be drawn and/or revised left behind by the person I was filling in for.<br>
<br>
This was not a short stack. It was as deep as my arm is long (I am not exaggerating). While I was there, I made it a point not to allow that pile to get any higher, and to diligently whittle the existing pile down to a reasonable height. <br>
<br>
In the beginning, I felt resentment towards me, like I was an outsider. I was familiar with this feeling from previous temp positions, but not to the extent that I felt here. Most of the people in the department were from Poland and/or Eastern Europe, it was completely understandable for them not to accept an outsider, but their actions and attitudes were very obvious.<br>
<br>
Within the 6 months that I at Matsushita, I learned a few new skills, made a couple new friends, impressed others in the department of my abilities, and eliminated that pile of back logged paperwork and drawings that needed to be completed.<br>
<br>
On my final day, I expected to go in, complete a couple small projects, and leave at the end of the day without being noticed. The people I worked with for the past 6 months had different plans.<br>
<br>
They decided to have a going away party. All day long there was food, and talking. Everyone told me how they were going to miss me, and that wished that I could stay, even if that meant the woman that I had replaced would be permanent. My supervisor confirmed that during my exit interview.

<p class=" description past-position">
    My first experience with a CAD system in a business environment was with this company. I was introduced to AutoCAD version 5 which utilized DOS 5-operating system and ran on an IBM type personal computer with a 286 DX processor with 2 monitors, one for the graphics and the other for the operator to see and review the line commands. Even though the mouse was originally introduced on the Apple Lisa and by now the Macintosh; and the Apple IIe were available, as well as Microsoft Windows it would still be a few more years before many business application software would embrace this technology. It would be a few more years before the mouse would be available on a PC, so for us early CAD operators, all of the X-Y &amp; Z co ordinances, line lengths, etc. had to be keyed in by hand. Of course the early AutoCAD systems had a tablet, which made life a little easier, but not much.<br>
<br>
For the first time in history, engineering drawings are able to be drawn with accuracy unmatched. Now drawing no longer will have the acronym NTS in the title block. Within the engineering department this denoted &#x201c;Not To Scale&#x201d;, but on the manufacturing floor this denoted &#x201c;Not To Sure&#x201d;. Either way will never occur again as long as drawings are drawn by CAD.<br>
<br>
The objective of a AutoCAD system was to create accurate and conscience drawings to scale. However, the down fall to a AutoCAD system (at this time) was time and data management. With many of these earlier systems it usually took more than a week to create a simple part drawing, and it usually took an absorbanent amount of time to simply call up a drawing from the computer&#x2019;s files. To regenerate the graphics on many of these earlier systems took more than 15 minutes to complete while some of the more complicated drawings took more than an hour.<br>
<br>
AutoCAD was here, and there was no turning back. And I used AutoCAD in developing Single Shot Castings for Hydraulic &amp; Pneumatic Manifold Valves.

    Returning as the Conquering hero, to Baxter as a legacy, with the reputation of successfully implementing a few major changes can be a bit overwhelming, especially when my return came as a request from the Vice President of Engineering. That really made the occasion unique and special, especially when those I was assigned to work with discovered who brought me back. At first there was some resentment towards me, but when it was explained to them where the door was life became a lot more organized. Once that was realized, I was given full rein of the project. I probably would have been granted access to whoever I needed from anywhere in the company on this particular project, but I didn&#x2019;t push it, and I didn&#x2019;t see it necessary for such action for this particular relatively simple project. Although I was brought in for this particular project as a managing consultant, my reputation never was one to &#x201c;MILK&#x201d; a project just to get a paycheck. I implemented the necessary changes and modifications and left.<br>
<br>
Just before I was ready to walk out the door, I was requested to meet with the Vice President of Engineering. Even though we were friends, we primarily professionally discussed all of the bureaucracy I by-passed in order to complete this project in a timely fashion. It was clear to both of us, that several people had created their own private kingdoms within the corporation for the sole purpose of proving their existence within the corporation. It became very obvious to both of us that if this project was allowed to run its normal course through the companies&#x2019; bureaucracy, it easily would have taken several years to complete.<br>
<br>
Although I wasn&#x2019;t there to actually witness the event. It was my understanding that several key individuals were called before the President and CEO the following week and were summarily dismissed while a few entire departments received their PINK slip with their next paycheck.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, many projects were able to be completed in record time.

    The toughest part of my career was establishing my professional morals and ethics and aligning them with my personal morals and ethical beliefs. Up until I worked with this particular employer, I would base my beliefs on how well I liked the people I called co-worker, or on the corporate culture/atmosphere of the company. It wasn&#x2019;t until I worked for this particular company that caused me to take a radical re-evaluation of my belief system.<br>
<br>
Up until I worked for this particular company, I would not concern myself with how I earned an income, but rather how much I would earn. I also tried to learn as much as I possibly could from every employer and co-worker and try to add that experience to my arsenal of knowledge.<br>
<br>
For the first time in my career, I had a reason to question the morals and ethics of the company that I earned my pay check from, but more importantly, I had reason to question the morals and ethics of the executives of a company that I worked for.

At the time, this company had two major customers, who strategically made up at least 90% of the sales and income.<br>
<br>
After a while, the designs became repetitive and/or mundane, or at the very least variations on the same theme.<br>
<br>
The smallest system that I designed was a single vacuum rotary vane pump mounted on top of a 30 gallon horizontal air receiver. The largest was a six SIHI&#xae; Liquid Ring Vacuum system with dual 500 gallon air receivers complete with its own stand alone water reservoir with each vacuum pumps operating in rotation so that there was an assumed even wear on each pump.<br>
<br>
Vacuum Systems Suck!!!<br>
And to prove it, the best, highest and most affective vacuum that I was ever able to achieve was 29.92&#x201d; Hg. with a SIHI&#xae; Liquid Ring Vacuum Pump. In my humble opinion that is pretty good, considering a perfect vacuum is 30&#x201d; Hg. and the only place that is achieved is outside of earth's atomsphere in outer space.

    First and only time in my career I was ever considered a minority.<br>
<br>
This company had many opportunities for me to pursue, as well as many challenges in the form of projects that were started by my predecessor that desperately needed immediate attention, but most importantly, many of these existing projects needed immediate attention in order to satisfy the needs of existing customers/clients.<br>
<br>
I was very capable of doing the work, and completing the work, but no one within this particular division didn&#x2019;t have a full understanding of what work needed to be completed, nor in what order, or in what timely manner. My greatest challenge with this company was NOT the work, but knowing where to begin, and what to accomplish first.<br>
<br>
I honestly liked the people in this company, and the type of work, and the corporate culture/atmosphere. I honestly believe that I could have stayed with this company for many years if it wasn&#x2019;t for a family emergency that demanded my full and immediate attention that caused me to ultimately resign from the company.

    Some of the best people that I know are awesome recruiters who placed me in some good companies. One of the most memorable recruiter that I remember is Ben Benson. We got to know a lot about each other, and eventually I found out that Ben lived in Bensenville. Ben had a great sense of humor and he did everything he could to place me in a good company. Little did he, or I know at the time, but this company did everything they could to cheat Ben out of his commission for placing me with this company.<br>
<br>
It was very difficult for me to adjust to a culture where the engineering staff did very little to ensure that their HVAC (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning) systems designs were balanced systems, or that the static pressure was as minimal as possible.<br>
<br>
As a favor to Ben, and because I respected him, and did not agree with what they were trying to do by cheating Ben and his efforts, I quit this company when I discovered they refused to pay Ben for his efforts.

Unfortunately, at the time the teletype machine themselves were on its way towards obsolescence with the dot-matrix printers coming onto the market, and fax machines, the Internet, and e-mail just a few years down the road.<br>

    Do you have any idea what it feels like to be hired, and within a week learn that your boss has just been terminated, and then be told by the vice president of the company that the only reason you were originally hired was to replace your boss who hired in the first place.<br>
 <br>
The primary product of Major Corporation was theatrical lighting and the systems that controlled them, but its bread and butter that sustained this company were commercial and industrial light fixtures.<br>
<br>
When I was hired, this company was recovering from a chapter 7 bankruptcy. One of my tasks was to create a computerized version of an MRP system, before there was in existence an efficient and effective computerized MRP system in existence. As you would guess, the first task was to itemize EVERYTHING, and place a monetary value for each item, Including every nut, screw, and washer.<br>
<br>
Then it was necessary to insure that every part drawing, sub-assembly, and every final assembly as well as every Bill of Material were 100% correct and accurate, including every nut, screw, washer, and warning sticker.<br>
<br>
Next it was necessary to conduct time studies, so that an accurate labor cost could be included into every final assembly. Once every cost had been accurately calculated and recorded, it was then discovered that the cost of nearly every product produced by this company was grossly under priced.

    I am going to date myself a little bit, by saying when I first started working for Baxter; it was as a member of the support staff of the sterilization group. The responsibility of this group (among other things) was to insure the compliance (for the FDA) of properly sterilizing the raw I.V. Bottles, and then pasteurize the finished product before shipment. This was a very labor intense process with ample opportunities to contaminate the product.<br>
<br>
You remember what an I.V. Bottle looks like. If you&#x2019;ve seen the T.V. Series M*A*S*H* or any other nostalgic type of old hospital dramatization, then you&#x2019;ve seen them as props in all of the hospital and O.R. scenes.<br>
<br>
Any ways, the next logical evolution to the I.V. Bottle was (and still is) the Via-flex&#xae; Bag or more commonly known as the I.V. Bag which is still in use to this day.<br>
<br>
Although, I cannot take any credit for the conception of the bag itself, I can however, take credit for my contribution to this group with my prototype design for the machine that cut the plastic, sealed the plastic (to form the bag), inserted the tubes, printed on the plastic, and then filled the bag with the product (solution) with minimal (if any) human contact, thus nearly eliminating the potential of contamination of the product.

    Try to imagine the hottest, dirtiest and dustiest working environment. Then try to place a machine in that environment with NEMA 1 electrical components and expect that machine to operate without fail.<br>
<br>
When I started work for this company that was everyone&#x2019;s expectations of the machines this company produced. Needless to say, it was that attitude that kept their customer service department hopping, busy, and usually out on service calls, often replacing failed relays and other electrical components. For me this was a NO BRAINER!!! Eliminate the Alkalis heel of the products that they were selling. Luckily I had a boss who felt the same way, but didn&#x2019;t know what direction to proceed. With a little education, I was able to convince my boss, and his assistant to allow me to produce a prototype to be unveiled by the end of the month.<br>
<br>
With a little assistance from my boss we designed and built a prototype with all solid state circuitry&#x2026; the first in the industry. We then demonstrated its effectiveness of this configuration to the president of the company and the entire sales and service department personnel, by shoveling shovel full after shovel full of sand directly into the control panel.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say that my actions directly change an entire industry that day.<br>
<br>
But my favorite machine made by this company was the ACO-24 (Abrasive Cut Off with a 24&#x201d; diameter diamond dust imbedded disk. The most amazing aspect of this machine wasn&#x2019;t the fact that it could cut through nearly 100&#x201d; of solid steel in less than a minute, but that it could do that and leave both sides of the kerf completely cold even though molten metal could easily be seen pooling behind the blade as it was cutting.<br>
<br>
My contributing innovation occurring at this company was in step with how dynamic this company was with the entire industry.

<p class=" description past-position">
    When I began my career, I began as a junior drafter with a local fastener manufacture right out of high school. About the same time, Am Trak was having some problems keeping their trains on the tracks. Some believed it was because of neglect others believed it was poor maintenance, I had my own theory.<br>
<br>
One day, I heard about a big train wreck, a couple of days later, this cocky 19 year old kid contacted the director of operation at Am Trak and asked him to send me some drawings (blue prints) of the wheel axial assembly. A couple of days later a truck pulled up and dropped off an entire wheel carriage assembly in my drive&#x2026; correction my father&#x2019;s driveway, I was still living at home at the time. Needless to say, dad was less than pleased.<br>
<br>
After a few friends of mine and I pushed that monstrosity into the garage, I began to examine it, I took photographs (old school 35mm), took measurements, and made a few sketches. All the while Dad kept asking when that &#x201c;THING&#x201d; was going to be out of his garage. A few days later, and I came up with a possible solution. I made a prototype, and then called the director of operations at Am Trak for an appointment to meet with him.<br>
<br>
A few days later, I met with the director of operations of Am Trak in his office. We had a nice conversation, and when it came to the purpose of the meeting, I placed on his desk my possible solution to his dilemma. A new type of NUT. A nut that can almost be completely threaded on by hand. A nut that is resistant to excessive vibration. And a nut that can only be removed with the aid of a hammer and cold chisel or an acetylene torch.<br>
<br>
This design of nut eventually held every railroad wheel on every railroad train car in North America for several decades. Eventually the original use for this particular style of nut was replaced by an elaborate device, but this particular style of nut is still in use in other capacities on railroad cars and within the railroad industry.

It is my distinct honor and privilege to coach many highly powerful and highly successful individuals who through no fault of their own found themselves between positions for an unexpected period of time. With a little coaching from me and a little perseverance from them many discovered how to develop a powerful LinkedIn Profile and network their way into new very successful positions.<br>
<br>
By dividing the curriculum into 3 sections concentrated in a given discipline provided success for those in various stages in their job search.<br>
- LinkedIn for the Beginners User - Passively Build your Profile (Part I)<br>
- LinkedIn for the Intermediate User - Assertively Build your Network (Part II)<br>
- LinkedIn for the Advanced User - Aggressively Go for that Job (Part III)<br>
<br>
<br>
Part I &#x2013; 47% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework.<br>
Part II &#x2013; 53% - 54% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework.<br>
Part III &#x2013; 34% landed a position within 100 days after successfully completing the curriculum and assigned homework. Often with more than one offer.

    It was my distinct honor and privilege to work with some of the most talented professional people that I know, and aid them and myself in obtaining clarity and direction in their job search during this time of economical uncertainty. It was truly an honor and learning experience on nearly every level of my personal and professional life. Each of the people that were in the group taught as well as learned from one another, and it is in this spirit that I sincerely hope that success to continue for each of them as well as myself. I truly hope that our paths will cross again under better circumstances. I made several NEW friends and I find comfort in knowing that I know will help me if they can when the occasion arises, and they in return know that I will help them if I can when the occasion arises.

<p class=" desc details-education">
    I obtained most of my adult education at the College of Lake County, located in Grayslake Illinois.<br>
<br>
I never felt it necessary to obtain a formal degree, but rather I did feel the need to further my education by taking individual courses as I needed the knowledge.<br>
<br>
I paid for every credit hour myself (in advance), never seeing the need to burden myself with unnecessary debt, or seeking a &quot;hand-out&quot; through scholarships, or grants.

<p class=" desc details-education">
    There were times when the courses that I needed were not available, or offered at the College of Lake County, so sometimes I had to improvise. Gateway was often the second choice when it came to my earlier adult education, primarily because of geographical location and convenience, otherwise I would try my local library or book store for book and other related material on the subject.<br>
<br>
Gateway Technical College is a business and their primary function is to turn a profit. Their primary function is not to educate.<br>
<br>
Need I say more?
