<p class=" description summary">
    Marc Davis invents mobile, social, media, and personal data technologies that connect people, the web, and the world. With a twenty year career of technology research and development spanning the MIT Media Lab, Interval Research, UC Berkeley, Yahoo!, Invention Arts, and Microsoft, he has done pioneering work in knowledge representation, metadata, video systems, context-aware computing, computer vision, mobile platforms and applications, social media, social search, mobile and social advertising, and personal data technologies and applications. He has transformed his ideas into over 200 patent applications, as well as numerous research prototypes, products, and publications. <br>
<br>
Marc is working on the technical, legal, and business foundations for our digital society and digital economy, so we can all benefit from having the right and ability to control the uses of our personal data.  Marc has articulated that we live in an age of &#x201c;digital feudalism&#x201d; that needs to be transformed by a &#x201c;digital enlightenment.&#x201d; Key to this effort is his work as a founding member of the World Economic Forum&#x2019;s Rethinking Personal Data Project and on the Global Agenda Council for Data-Driven Development. Marc was featured in the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Outlook 2013. <br>
<br>
At Microsoft, Marc worked on the vision and technology strategy for the Online Services Division. He helped transform social search by moving Bing from the &#x201c;Web of Pages&#x201d; to the &#x201c;Web of People&#x201d; so that searching for almost any topic returns friends and other people specifically relevant to the person doing the query, as seen in Bing&#x2019;s Sidebar. Marc was Assistant Professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information where he co-founded the Berkeley Center for New Media and directed Garage Cinema Research, where he pioneered context-aware mobile media tagging, sharing, and face recognition. <br>
<br>
Marc&#x2019;s work has been featured in the New York Times, San Jose Mercury News, Atlantic Monthly, GigaOm, Huffington Post, and Forbes.

Providing a historically and philosophically informed view of today&#x2019;s internet, Marc has articulated that in terms of political economy we live in an age of &#x201c;digital feudalism&#x201d; that needs to be transformed by a &#x201c;digital enlightenment&#x201d; brought about by people reclaiming in the online world the human rights, property rights, speech rights, civil society, and democratic governance we achieved in the physical world.  Key to this effort is Marc&#x2019;s work as a founding member of the World Economic Forum Rethinking Personal Data Project and as a member of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council for Data-Driven Development. This year Marc was featured in the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Outlook 2013 report in a dialogue with Robert Madelin moderated by Rod Beckstrom, which articulated the &#x201c;Thriving in a Hyperconnected World&#x201d; theme, and Marc was also selected by the European Commission to respond to the their &#x201c;Onlife Manifesto: Being human in a hyperconnected era&#x201d; which is part of the EU&#x2019;s Digital Agenda for Europe.

    At Microsoft, Marc was a Partner Architect who worked on the vision and technology strategy for Microsoft&#x2019;s Online Services Division, especially in the areas of online identity, personal data, privacy, and social computing. Marc and his Early Stage Products (ESP) team developed prototypes to help realize his vision of a &#x201c;Web of the World&#x201d; that empowers people by putting them at the center of their digital lives and delivers trusted, personalized services that connect people, the web, and the world in new ways. For example, Marc and his team worked on transforming social search by moving Bing from the &#x201c;Web of Pages&#x201d; to the &#x201c;Web of People&#x201d; so that searching for almost any topic or interest would return friends and other people specifically relevant to the person doing the query.  Based on initial prototypes from Marc&#x2019;s team, the Bing Sidebar connects searchers to the friends and other people relevant to their searches and enables them to communicate with these relevant people to help them get things done.  Another social search prototype conceived and developed by Marc and his team, &#x201c;Bing Linked Pages&#x201d; enabled people to easily link web pages that are by or about them to their Facebook identity and have these Linked Pages appear in Bing when people searched for them.  Bing Linked Pages was described by ReadWrite as &#x201c;what Google+ should have been.&#x201d; Klout has now adopted Bing Linked Pages as Klout Tags. Marc and his team were also instrumental at Microsoft in the conception, architecture, prototyping, and development of the platforms underlying Microsoft&#x2019;s latest efforts to deliver highly personalized information services that use personal and social data with user permission and control.

    As Chief Scientist of Yahoo! Mobile, Marc Davis focused on inventing and realizing the key technologies, platforms, and applications that would shape the future of mobile for billions of people around the world. His research encompassed  the theory, design, and development of sociotechnical systems that leverage contextual metadata and the power of community to enable people around the world to produce, describe, share, and remix media, and to connect to each other in new ways. <br>
<br>
Much of Marc&#x2019;s invention, and prolific, fundamental patent work at Yahoo! was focused on the technologies and applications at the core of the mobile social &#x201c;Web of the World&#x201d; we are now starting to live in.  As observed in an insightful article about Marc&#x2019;s &#x201c;AttentionRank&#x201d; patent, it appears to cover &#x201c;everything that can be found on the Web as well as anything (any real world entity) that can be connected somehow to the internet.&#x201d;

    Yahoo! Research Berkeley was a research partnership between Yahoo! Inc. and the University of California at Berkeley to explore and invent social media and mobile media technology and applications that will enable people to create, describe, find, share, and remix media on the web. Yahoo! Research Berkeley combined world-class media technology and design research with the scale and impact of the world's leading internet media company. We brought together world-renowned experts in the fields of media technology, social software, context-aware computing, mobile computing, and user and design research who shaped the future of internet media. In support of these goals, Yahoo! Research Berkeley and the University of California at Berkeley  created an innovative corporate-academic collaboration for research and development.<br>

    The disclosure describes systems and methods for utilizing data collected and stored on multiple devices in order to improve the performance of the network via a markup language for addressing and delivering communications. The markup language invokes W4COMN operations through a free-form, natural language syntax which enables completely personalized user-defined designations for real-world entities (RWEs) or information objections (IOs) utilizing names or functional tags. Desired network operations including addressing network resources, entities or users are activated when the markup language is augmented via processing with W4 contextual data into an actual W4COMN circuit, process or event.

    A service provider facilitates consumption of goods, brands, or services on an interactive network using characterizations of consumers, behavior, brands, consumable goods, advertisers, and advocates to determine a three-way match between a consumable good, a consumer, and an advocate. The matching method determines one or more goods likely to be benefit from the marketing scheme by maximizing the estimated contextual value of personalized advocacy. Further, the service provider captures the value of the personalized advocacy in each match, and distributes that value in the form of various marketing incentives.

<p class=" description">
    Methods and systems for processing multimedia content captured from a plurality of locations via one or more capturing devices include obtaining multimedia content from one or more capturing devices. The capturing devices identify a type of content being captured and/or location of capture. An interest type for multimedia content is obtained from a consuming user. The multimedia content from the capturing devices are searched based on the interest type of the consuming user. A subset of the multimedia content conforming to the interest type is presented in substantial real-time at the receiving devices of the consuming users. Feedback regarding the presented multimedia content is obtained from consuming users and communicated to the capturing devices in substantial real-time so as to influence future capture of multimedia content. The methods also include receiving a request for recording a live event wherein the request provides one or more recording preferences including one or more requester preferences for recording the live event. The request is dynamically matched to one or more generating users who have expressed intentions for recording the live event. The generating users are associated with one or more capturing devices that are configured to record the live event based on the recording preferences of the request. The request is then forwarded to the matched one or more generating users for recording the live event. User interactions at the recordings are monitored and fed back to the generating users for further refining the recordings.

<p class=" description">
    A system and method for precaching information on a mobile device. A precaching strategy is built for a mobile device The strategy defines a forecast of data types a user is predicted to request after the occurrence of one or more data refresh conditions. The precaching strategy is built by recognizing data usage patterns in data requested by the user or a group of users over a time period. The data usage pattern comprises data types and events that are correlated to the usage of the data. The events are used to define at least one refresh condition within the precaching strategy. The precaching strategy is executed. When the occurrence of the data refresh condition is detected, data is then retrieved from a data source, wherein the data is retrieved according to the precaching strategy. The retrieved data is transmitted to a user device cache.

    The disclosure describes systems and methods delivering communications associated with delivery conditions in which the occurrence of the delivery condition is determined by monitoring information received from a plurality of sources via multiple communication channels. The message delivery systems allow messages to be delivered to any &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; from any &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; upon the detection of an occurrence of one or more &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; delivery conditions. A message (which may be any data object including text-based messages, audio-based message such as voicemail or other audio such as music or video-based prerecorded messages) is delivered in accordance with delivery conditions based on any available data, including topical, spatial, temporal, and/or social data. Furthermore, because the systems coordinate delivery of messages via multiple communication channels and through multiple devices, the communication channel for delivery of a message may be dynamically determined based on the delivery conditions.

    Methods and system for managing demand for an object includes capturing information about the object through a mobile device associated with a user. The mobile device is configured to capture information about the object that include one or more of a spatial, temporal, topical and social attributes of the object. The identity of the object is verified and validated using this metadata captured by the user through the device from the real world object or its proxy. Upon successful verification and validation, the object and its metadata are automatically added to a wish list of the user. An aggregate list is generated using the attributes and metadata of the object from a plurality of users. The aggregate list defines a source of demand for the object. The object is tracked as it progresses through various phases of ownership cycle using dynamic demand calculations based on the information associated with the objects, the users and the aggregate lists.

    A system and methodology for visually representing user activity associated with an information resource is described. Online and offline activities of users are associated with symbolic representations of those users. In an embodiment, the symbolic representation of a user has the appearance of a dust particle. The dust particle can provide a universal and unobtrusive visual representation of the online or offline activity of the represented user. Further, the dust particle can exist for the represented user to communicate with other users with privacy and anonymity. To visually convey selected aspects of an online or offline activity, the activity is mapped to visual attributes that alter the dust particle behavior and/or appearance. The result is a dynamic and universal representation of online and offline user activities associated with an information resource such as a web page, database, or document that can help other online users efficiently discern the relevancy and popularity of the information resource.

Furthermore, because the systems coordinate delivery of messages via multiple communication channels and through multiple devices, the communication channel for delivery of a message may be dynamically determined based on the delivery conditions.

<p class=" description">
    The disclosure describes systems and methods for disambiguating a non-unique identifiers of real world entities (RWEs) detected by a computing network by dynamically identifying relationships between RWEs known to the network. The relationships are determined based on social, spatial, temporal and logical information known about the RWEs based on the RWEs previous interactions with the network. These relationships are then used to generate a probability for each RWE that the non-unique identifier identifies that RWE. Based on the probabilities an RWE is selected and the proper network identifier may be used in place of the non-unique identifier.

The system and method advantageously enables data to be shared among co-located sensors in a manner that does not require local connections or communication among those sensors and that protects user privacy. The system and method also beneficially enables data to be transferred among heterogeneous sensor types that would otherwise be incapable of detecting and/or communicating with each other. The system and method may perform user-initiated data transfer as well as automatic data transfer responsive to sensor proximity and other factors, such as commonality of user interests or activities or membership in a social network.

    A system and method is described for constructing a proximity-based ad hoc network among a plurality of sensors and for using such a network to perform location tracking. The system and method uses time-coded data received from each of the sensors to determine a current proximity of each of the sensors to one or more beacons. Then, by leveraging information relating to the effective transmission ranges of the beacons, the system and method determines the relative location of each of the plurality of sensors with respect to other sensors within the plurality of sensors. Where actual (as opposed to relative) location information is available for a particular sensor, it can be used to generate or augment location information associated with other sensors known to be spatially and temporally proximate to the particular sensor. The current location information for each of the sensors is then used in providing location-based services.

    A system is described for determining the active copresence of users during interactions. The system may include a processor, a memory, and an interface. The memory may store a degree of active copresence. The interface may communicate with a user. The processor may identify a primary interaction of the user. The processor may determine whether the user engages in a secondary interaction while the user is engaged in the primary interaction. The processor may determine the degree of active copresence of the user during the primary interaction based on a quality score of the primary interaction and a quality score of the secondary interaction. The degree of active copresence may represent the level of engagement of the user during the primary interaction. The processor may provide the degree of active copresence to the user via the interface.

    A system and method for URL based query for retrieving data related to a context. A request is received over a network from a user for data related to a context, wherein the request is a URL comprising a context query comprising at least one context criteria. The context criteria are parsed and translated and disambiguated. A network data query is formulated based on the context criteria so as to search, via the network, for user profile data, social network data, spatial data, temporal data and topical data that is available via the network and relates to the context query so as to identify at least one data object that relates to context criteria. Permissions relating to the identified data objects are checked and references to the data objects are transmitted over the network to the user.

<p class=" description">
    A system is provided for tracking a mobile device by enabling a user to remotely monitor the external surrounding environment of the mobile device. Initially, a mobile device is configured to selectively report on the device's surrounding environment based on one or more reporting events. Upon an occurrence of a reporting event, the mobile device generates a report by capturing at least one sensory datum related to its external surrounding environment. At least one locating datum is included in the report which can provide at least an approximate geographic location of the mobile device at the time the report is generated. Once the report is generated, the mobile device selectively sends the report to a tracking assist server, which makes the report remotely accessible to the user. Accordingly, when a mobile device is missing, a user can review one or more reports accessible on the server to determine whether the mobile device is stolen. Additionally, the at least one sensory datum provided in the one or more reports can be used to assist the user or others in identifying persons and/or objects in the surrounding environment of the mobile device, which may lead to the identification of the thief and/or recovery of the mobile device.

    The disclosure describes systems and methods delivering communications associated with delivery conditions in which the occurrence of the delivery condition is determined by monitoring information received from a plurality of sources via multiple communication channels. The message delivery systems allow messages to be delivered to any &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; from any &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; upon the detection of an occurrence of one or more &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; delivery conditions. A message (which may be any data object including text-based messages, audio-based message such as voicemail or other audio such as music or video-based prerecorded messages) is delivered in accordance with delivery conditions based on any available data, including topical, spatial, temporal, and/or social data. Furthermore, because the systems coordinate delivery of messages via multiple communication channels and through multiple devices, the communication channel for delivery of a message may be dynamically determined based on the delivery conditions.

    Embodiments are directed towards managing an adaptive media object to dynamically represent a persona reflecting a group's (or individual's) online and/or offline activities and behaviors. The group selects the adaptive media object to represent their persona digitally. The group may indicate which activities, actions, and/or behaviors are to be used to adapt the persona, and may further specify at least one mapping of a selected activity, action, and/or behavior to a change in the configuration of the adaptive media object. In one embodiment, the various activities, actions, and/or behaviors may be input to a machine learning algorithm that dynamically determines the changes to the adaptive media object. The adaptive media object may serve as a single point of contact for the group or individual for communications. The adaptive media object configuration may also change based upon the client device used to access the adaptive media object.

    The disclosure describes systems and methods of ranking user interest in physical entities based on the attention given to those entities as determined by an analysis of communications from devices over multiple communication channels. The attention ranking systems allow any &#x201c;Who, What, When, Where&#x201d; entity to be defined and ranked based, at least in part, on information obtained from communications between users and user proxy devices. An entity rank is generated for entity known to the system in which the entity rank is derived from the information in communications that are indicative of user actions related to the entity. The entity ranks are then used to modify the display of information or data associated with the entities. The system may also generate a personal rank for each entity based on the relation of the entity to a specified user.

    Disclosed are apparatus and methods for facilitating annotation of media objects by a user. Mechanisms present a user with an easily usable set of annotation suggestions that are most likely to be relevant to the particular user and/or media context. In general, existing annotations are analyzed to determine a set of suggested annotations. Annotation suggestions for a particular user are based on an analysis of the relevance, to the particular user, of existing annotations of one or more media objects so that the most likely relevant annotations are presented as suggested annotations. In particular embodiments, this analysis depends on whether the existing annotations were created and/or selected by the particular user, a member of the particular user's social network, or members of the general public.

<p class=" description">
    An attention manager presents information to a person in the vicinity of a display device in a manner that engages at least the peripheral attention of the person. The information is embodied by one or more sets of content data (e.g., video or audio data). Each set of content data is formulated by a content provider and made available for use by content display systems. Upon appropriate activation, each content display system displays images corresponding to the sets of content data in accordance with predetermined scheduling information. The attention manager makes use of &quot;unused capacity&quot; of the display device and the person's attention, providing information to the person that the person might not otherwise expend adequate energy to obtain. The attention manager also affords an opportunity to content providers to disseminate their information to people that are interested in receiving such information, enabling the content providers to provide better directed information dissemination, as well as providing access to the previously unused attention capacity of those interested people.

<p class=" description">
    Existing media signals are processed to create new media content by defining content representations for the existing media and establishing functional dependencies between the representations. The content representations constitute different data types which determine the kinds of operations that can be performed and dependencies that can be established. Among the types of transformation that can be achieved are synchronization, substitution resequencing temporal compression and dilation, and the creation of parametric special effects. The content representations and their functional dependencies are combined to construct a functional dependency network which causes the desired transformations to occur on input media signals. The inputs to the functional dependency network are parametrically specified by media data types to construct a template that can be used to create adaptive media productions.

    In this paper, we focus on the use of context-aware, collaborative filtering, machine-learning techniques that leverage automatically sensed and inferred contextual metadata together with computer vision analysis of image content to make accurate predictions about the human subjects depicted in cameraphone photos. We apply Sparse-Factor Analysis (SFA) to both the contextual metadata gathered in the MMM2 system and the results of PCA (Principal Components Analysis) of the photo content to achieve a 60% face recognition accuracy of people depicted in our cameraphone photos, which is 40% better than media analysis alone. In short, we use context-aware media analysis to solve the face recognition problem for cameraphone photos.

<p class=" ''">
    Cameraphones are rapidly becoming a global platform for everyday digital imaging especially for networked sharing of media from mobile devices. However, their constrained user interfaces and the current network and application infrastructure encumber the basic tasks of transferring, finding, and sharing captured media. We have deployed a prototype context-aware cameraphone application for mobile media sharing (MMM2) that aims to overcome these difficulties. MMM2 leverages the point of capture and of sharing to gather metadata, and uses metadata to support sharing. Based on the early results of the first 6 weeks of a six-month trial involving 60 users, indications are that with MMM2 users are actively capturing and sharing photos. The ability to automatically upload photos from a cameraphone to a web-based photo management application and to automatically suggest sharing recipients at the time of capture based on Bluetooth-sensed co-presence and sharing frequency promise to reduce the current difficulty of mobile media sharing.

    Developments in networked digital imaging promise to substantially affect the near-universal experience of personal photography. Designing technology for image capture and sharing requires an understanding of how people use photos as well as how they adapt emerging technology to their photographic practices, and vice versa. In this paper, we report on an empirical study of the uses made of a prototype context-aware cameraphone application for mobile media sharing, and relate them to prior work on photographic practices. By reducing many of the barriers to cameraphone <br>
use and image sharing (including increasing image quality, easing the sharing process, and removing cost barriers), we find that users quickly develop new uses for imaging. Their innovative communicative uses of imaging are understandable in terms of the social uses identified from prior photographic activity; new functional uses are developing as well.

    The recent popularity of mobile camera phones allows for new opportunities to gather important metadata at the point of capture. This paper describes a method for generating metadata for photos using spatial, temporal, and social context. We describe a system we implemented for inferring location information for pictures taken with camera phones and its performance evaluation. We propose that leveraging contextual metadata at the point of capture can address the problems of the semantic and sensory gaps. In particular, combining and sharing spatial, temporal, and social contextual metadata from a given user and across users allows us to make inferences about media content.

<p class=" ''">
    Current computing systems are just beginning to enable the computational manipulation of temporal media like video and audio. Because of the opacity of these media they must be represented in order to be manipulable according to their contents. Knowledge representation techniques have been implicitly designed for representing the physical world and its textual representations. Temporal media pose unique problems and opportunities for knowledge representation which challenge many of its assumptions about the structure and function of what is represented. The semantics and syntax of temporal media require representational designs which employ fundamentally different conceptions of space, time, identity, and action. In particular, the effect of the syntax of video sequences on the semantics of video shots demands a representational design which can clearly articulate the differences between the context-dependent and context-independent semantics of video data. This paper outlines the theoretical foundations for designing representations of video, discusses Media Streams, an implemented system for video representation and retrieval, and critiques related efforts in this area.
