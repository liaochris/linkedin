<p class=" description past-position">
    James was one of fifteen technology directors responsible for leading technical initiatives and business development for a broad range of clients. In addition to leadership and mentoring, he provided services to clients including: architecture, development management, solution definition, program management, process optimization, and software systems analysis.  Sierra Systems conducts most of its business in western Canada and has a significant presence in Alberta.  James worked on projects for the B.C. Government in Justice, Health and in the OCIO; he also worked for the government in the state of Washington, and was involved in the initial architecture design for a project for Alberta Parks.  James worked within and in some cases helped implement development process for these clients in RUP, Agile and Waterfall.  James worked in many roles including architect, developer, program and project manager for both Public and Private clients.  Primarily, James was the Solution Architect for the Electronic Justice Record project for the Ministry of Attorney General.  The needs and priorities of the technical and business participants were to be balanced and considered in delivering a solution that met the project charter and objectives.  In this role, James leveraged his knowledge of business process modeling to develop a conceptual architecture that encompassed the broad needs of all stakeholders.  James was responsible for all technical aspects of the solution including architecture, development methods, testing, scalability, security and stability.  James was also responsible for a full business process review and definition of the B.C. Registries OneStop system using BPMN.  James also worked with the Office of the Chief Information Officer of B.C to define the proposed Identity and access management strategy and architecture; this effort ultimately led to the latest version of BCeID and the new Driver&#x2019;s License and Services Card integration.

    Built a local engineering team of 15 and an offshore team (Yugoslavia) of 10 to quickly rework existing company software product assets into an evolving Web 2.0 solution through a highly agile process.  James communicated all technical capabilities and challenges to the board and was responsible for the direction of the technology of the organization.  This included business case development, envisioning, planning and cost/benefit analysis.  Primary languages were Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Python. Media sharing across the web was at the time still in its infancy &#x2013; especially on any mobile platforms.  There were significant challenges on optimizing the approach for content distribution due to network, memory and processor constraints.  The primary challenge was to create an excellent user experience on devices that were not typically capable of receiving and presenting media rich content in an efficient manner. The company has since morphed these assets into a platform that successfully targets large media companies wanting to advertise their video assets across different platforms on the web.

James spearheaded the use of software factories and code generation techniques in the company solution (a dynamical driven SOA enterprise information sharing technology).  James was responsible for all aspect of the enterprise capabilities of the technology including scalability, stability, security and extensibility.  Visiphor was a leader in SOA and its use as information sharing technology as well as an innovator in software factories. James was responsible for the company&#x2019;s enterprise information sharing and integration technology.  The solution was ground breaking in the field of the Semantic Web and Ontological structures for information access.  Extensive research and development was conducted in the search capabilities of the solution and the meta-data structures that defined the ontological forms that facilitated the search solution.

    James co-developed a face recognition algorithm with the CTO of Imagis Technologies in 1999-2003.  This software was sold primarily in British Columbia to Police and RCMP. The face recognition system identified faces in a database of millions of images and returned search results in less than one second.  It was a highly scalable system built on emerging 64-bit technology. The project required deep algorithmic development and leveraged his extensive background in math and physics.  The solution also utilized the emerging 64-bit Windows architecture.  The solution architecture and use of Microsoft technologies was demonstrated as a case study in Copenhagen at the European Microsoft Technology Summit in 2002.  The company and its assets have been sold several times over and the face recognition algorithm is now owned by i2, an IBM Company.

    James was asked to review and assess the RBCM collection and management software and web solution for public search of the collections. After review of existing issues, he developed a solution and a set of recommendations for a path forward. He also found a solution for extracting the museums critical data from a proprietary binary file system that had been previously thought to be inaccessible and developed software to do this. James advised the CIO on how best to move the enterprise away from a difficult and proprietary built legacy system to a modern integrated solution. He defined a technical architecture, information architecture and roadmap on how to move towards this ideal state. This plan was accepted by the CIO and James is now leading the project to implement the recommendations.

    James is providing assistance, knowledge and guidance to the IAO throughout their RFP process of identifying a COTS solution for their freedom of information access management software. The Ministry of Citizen Services is leading the initiative to define requirements, develop and publish the RFP and assess the respondents. James has advised on the approach and defined the current and ideal state technical architecture for the IAO. He was responsible for the technical sections of the RFP and was on the committee that assessed the respondents. This committee collaborated and ultimately chose the successful COTS vendor. The final component of the work will be to develop an approach and strategy for implementation and deployment of the solution with the vendor of choice. Considerations will include timelines, budget, workforce constraints, operational constraints and integration requirements.

    James was responsible for the development of an enterprise architecture framework approach for definition of the EA models, and the definition of the EA models for the current state of the SABC solution. The framework was a simplified version of a combination of Zachman and Togaff tailored to the specific needs of SABC. The fundamentals of EA and the development of the models were formal EA practices and patterns, but streamlined to be performed in a short time span with limited resources. The relevant phase of the project was to define the current state of the solution across business process, information and systems, and to develop high level requirements for the new solution. With these two assets, the intent was to define a proposed solution and application architecture and provide initial estimates of scope, cost and phasing. James led the current state definition requirements and supported the solution proposal process. He was responsible for defining the Enterprise Architecture framework and gathering current state information to define the framework models. The EA framework was designed to ensure that strategic objectives, desired business outcomes, stakeholder needs are being met through improvements in the solution business processes, information architecture and application architecture. James constructed a methodology to define the new solution requirements, design and architecture to ensure that business and IM/IT were in alignment. He was responsible for capturing the current state business processes and identified and detailed over 40 distinct processes through workshops and collaboration.

    James was responsible for the application of EA methodology for development of a described to-be state for the suite of investment management software that was being modernized. This project was an aggressive and large-scale enterprise-wide solution. This transformational project was in progress and assistance was required to ensure that at project completion there was an adequate description of the solution across all EA models: stakeholder, stakeholder needs, business strategy, business outcomes, business process and rules, information architecture, data models and systems architecture, etc. The approach needed to fit the timelines and dependencies of the program as it was mission critical. James worked closely with the Vice President of technology to ensure that at project completion the operations team was able to assume ownership of the software solution and continue to function effectively and efficiently.

    James was asked to research and develop a strategy document for the mobile technology landscape and roadmap for the B.C. government. This included capturing the needs of all stakeholders to ensure that a cohesive strategy and approach for mobile would be provided. The focus was on both business and technology; understanding of stakeholder needs, desired business outcomes, and constraints were balanced to provide a solution for delivering the best mobile experience. This included logical flow charts for business decisions outcomes, an assessment of current capabilities, and a recommendation of phases and next steps to implement the high level roadmap. The deliverable was a document that outlined the mobile technology landscape and a roadmap to implement the proposed architecture. In addition, an example web site was developed the application of the proposed strategy to validate the approach and demonstrate its benefits and value. There was significant complexity in balancing all of the needs across government and the needs of the citizen mobile user. The mobile framework outlined implementation details and methodologies for infrastructure and middleware, metadata models, and integration with existing systems (e.g. web, application, database, web content management (WCM), web analytics, security). James was the single resource responsible for all of the deliverables. His primary recommendation was for the province to adopt a Responsive Design and Progressive Enhancement approach utilizing HTML5 and CSS3. His background in the technical and business aspects of IT allowed James to balance all of the stakeholder needs and define a mobile strategy optimal for the province. His ability to understand detailed technical concepts, solution and application architecture and his experience with mobile were instrumental in the project&#x2019;s success.

    James was asked to review the current strategy, approach and architecture for the Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) and Master Data Management (MDM) elements of the WorkSafeBC suite of software. There was a need to ensure that a viable strategy was in place to ensure that desired SOA practices were being implemented and that the proposed MDM approach would meet the needs of the enterprise. James conducted an in-depth review of their current solution suite and met with many technical and business stakeholders. After holding several information sessions, James proposed a revision of the approach and strategy currently in-place and outlined these findings in a set of deliverables. The solution provided a better utilization of SOA practices that supported a MDM approach for the enterprise. The end deliverable was a document that outlined the recommendations as well as steps to implement them. Several information sessions on SOA and MDM were held and supporting material was provided for future reference.

    James advised the CIO for how to define the foundation for an Enterprise Information Architecture best suited to meet the needs of the sector and fulfil the Provincial Information Management Guidelines. The definition of Enterprise Information Management within the context of Enterprise Architecture will lay the foundation of the provincial government&#x2019;s efforts to share information openly and securely. James was responsible for defining this approach and describing the initial efforts and planning required to implement the program. The architecture was based on the TOGAFF and Zachman frameworks and is a derivative of these frameworks that is specifically designed to meet the needs of this large government ministry. As part of the suite of deliverables, a roadmap was developed that clearly outlined the next steps and stages of the program to implement the solution. Several models were developed during this engagement including information architecture, data governance and management relationships and conceptual systems architecture models. The solution framed the high level plan put forth from the Ministry CIO to treasury for the 2012 budget.

    James designed the enterprise data model that met the social networking and collaboration needs of the web application. With a potential for high bandwidth transfers, the requirement for a highly scalable system that is stable and secure was paramount &#x2013; James was responsible for the design of the system that will meet these needs. As this was a burgeoning start-up, the architect role was all encompassing; this included the web front end, business logic tier, data tier, external service providers and integration. James undertook all aspects of the database including code development, implementation, maintenance, enhancements and testing. The DB choice was also determined by an in-depth analysis provided by James to meet the specific needs of the business; the DB of choice was the open source solution PostgreSql. James worked closely with the off-shore development team (Pakistan) and mentored the CEO and technical leads on the best practices for off-shore agile development.

<p class=" ''">
    James worked primarily as the Enterprise Architect but helped with systems scalability and reliability analysis, program and product management process changes, SDK development strategy and project development and as the technical representative during potential merger / acquisitions / partnership cycles. James developed an extensive set of enterprise architecture models that described all aspect of the business. This included systems, information, data, services, business process, asset transformation and asset delivery; these models combined to create a complete picture of the capabilities of the enterprise and were a key factor in the successful sale of the company to NewsCorp (over rival bidders Google and Samsung). Key to the architect role was the responsibility for the overall design to meet all of the complex requirements that the solution demanded. This included the ability to deliver custom formatted content to the diverse range of mobile platforms and ensure that it was done in a stable, secure and scalable approach. James was responsible for ensuring the SDK met the needs of the partners and personally met with Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Apple, Google and others in fulfillment of his role. He provided expert knowledge of SOA in their implementation of a 3rd party ecosystem; this included in depth use of XML, XSD, XSLT, WSDL, UDDI, REST and SOAP. James led the design process in collaborative workshops across the organization (in very disparate locations including the India based off-shore group) and was the lead architect and technical representative to the business.
