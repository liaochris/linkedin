    <p class="description">This position, which links with five continuing education centers, is for building capacity in the areas of functional English for very advanced students. These students are motivated to learn and wish to add to their abilities in the areas of international relations. The demand for this form of education continues to increase in the over three hundred colleges and universities in Korea. This center which follows a significantly evolved curriculum focussed on the direct needs of the students - fills one of the vacuums in the current educational system in Korea. As it concentrates on students who are interested in English from the perspective of both its socio-economic role in the world,as well as for those challenged by the job market here and abroad, I hope to add value to the Senior Teacher, the Dean of the University, the five branches, and the small team of teachers.</p>

    <p class="description">A key position for me in  South Korea. A short term contract to determine the ability of the elementary school system to absorb modern and innovative ESL methods through the actual practice and the importation of recent North American techniques. Seoul Metropolitan is a massive educational entity, with thousands of personnel! And thousands of students.<br>
There were, of course , the usual complexities of dealing with unions who are highly entrenched, visible and in conflict with the school - in addition to the pressures of dealing with the parents, the Korean teacher, and other problems such as lack of resources.<br>
The curriculum is fully supported by the Government - however, this form of English as a Second Language has been difficult to integrate to the school system throughout Korea during the course of the past ten years, for a slew of linguistic-cultural reasons. Only a  fifth of the students wish to learn! Only a portion of the school administration supports the teachers.</p>
