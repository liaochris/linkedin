            <h2>Shane Frizzell&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have spent the past decade in various roles within the healthcare industry.  Starting from the ground floor as a claims processor and working my way through the ranks as a configuration guru on the AMISYS platform as well as assuming the role of Reimbursement Manager and establishing fee schedules and payment methodologies for several Medicaid lines of business.<br>
<br>
I have had the benefit of wearing many hats with lots of exposure to many manners of operationally addressing problems due to my extensive work history with several different companies.  <br>
<br>
Even though my current role is one where I am totally software focused, I would still enjoy any opportunities where I could become an operational resource for any small to large based HMO, commercially driven insurance company, or Medicaid MCO based in the Middle TN area or other areas where a telecommute experience is available.<br>
<br>
As is evidenced by my various roles and my overall experience level, I would be a definite asset to any company looking for someone that could take charge of issues and develop quick solutions and streamline processes to make a claims shop run more effectively.
