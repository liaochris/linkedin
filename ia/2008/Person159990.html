              <p class="summary">
                UPDATE IF YOU KNOW ME:  Back in the Bay Area.  Left IncaGold in March 2007 to found Stiki Digital, to focus on our new content marketplace, with first product line Stiki Digital Promotions live now.  Just got funded by prominent Silicon Valley investors and plan on formal launch in January, though we are live for customers now.<br>
<br>
IF YOU DON'T:  12 years total experience, the last 8 years focused on high-tech early-stage start-up companies, in sr. mgmt. positions, to help drive them to the next stage.  Experienced the dot.com bust, the subsequent downturn and VC crunch, but maintained a steady series of roles with escalating responsibility.  This has enabled me to return to founding my own start-up which I am currently growing.<br>
<br>
ACHIEVEMENTS:<br>
<br>
&#x2022;	Founded Stiki Digital March 2007.<br>
&#x2022;	Designed digital distribution system for IP content, in 2005. Built prototype and sold technology to UK-based public company Dec05.<br>
&#x2022;	Launched the leading ASP product in the mobile workforce management space, taking product to the number one spot in the US market (now has over 50% market share), built channels from scratch, personally closed the first 200+ deals.<br>
&#x2022;	Co-founded White Rose Entrepreneurship program to place UK science and technology undergraduates into internships with high-tech Silicon Valley start-ups, UK government and VC firm 3i.<br>
&#x2022;	Founded InfoVault, Inc. in 1999. Named Entrepreneur of the Month in the July 1999 issue of European &#x201c;Real Business&#x201d; magazine, which profiled InfoVault<br>
*  In June 2000 I was featured in a BBC documentary on UK start-up entrepreneurs moving to Silicon Valley, for which I spent several weeks being trailed by a camera crew (which is an interesting experience in itself!).<br>
&#x2022;	1997-1999 First management role: ran Europe &amp; Africa Service Desk for engineering giant; built team of 30; turned around first-call fix 17%-70%+, saving $8-10million per year!

    <p class="description">At the time I joined Xora was an enterprise mobilization platform company.  After a tour of the key sales regions I quickly saw the platform was a poor fit for carrier channel. I brought this feedback from channel to exec. team who had the vision to back an ASP/SAAS version of the product. I led drive to build hosted service, initially as a side project with just me plus the necessary engineering resources.  Product was so successful that Xora refocused company around it. <br>
<br>
Created initial product spec&#x2019;s from channel feedback, created value proposition, pushed through an initially hostile channel, de-positioned competitors in key markets. Personally closed 100% of Xora&#x2019;s GPS TimeTrack business (which represented 100% of Xora&#x2019;s total sales) 2003 Q1-3.  <br>
<br>
Made Xora the number one selling mobile data application in its space in just six months - a market it dominates today.</p>

      <p class="notes">Leeds was the most applied-to uni in the UK at the time, probably for two main reasons: 1) strong academics 2) a vibrant young exciting city that catered well to a large student population.  I loved my time there and strongly recommend it.<br>
<br>
&#x95;	Fall 92:	Introweek Organizer, University of Leeds Student Union - part of a small team, organized a week of events to a budget of US$100,000 to entertain students in their first week at university and help them settle in.  This involved managing high-profile (temperamental) celebrities/recording artists and large crowds with patience!<br>
<br>
&#x95;	93-94: 	National Advertising Officer, Student Radio Association &#x96; secured national sponsors &amp; advertisers; had an my active role in student radio at university, where I hosted a weekly music show<br>
<br>
&#x95;	92-94:	Computer Consulting &#x96; in spare time (including taking year out before my final year) started a small company building/selling PC&#x92;s to small business<br>
<br>
&#x95;	94-95:	Captained departmental cricket team<br>
