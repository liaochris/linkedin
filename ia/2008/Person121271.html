    <p class="description">SilverPlatter was an electronic publisher supplying mainly educational institutions and large businesses with fully searchable databases of information.<br>
<br>
After completing my degree in May 1998, I was employed by SilverPlatter as an Internet Software Engineer. After successful delivery of their WebAdmin 1.0 product, I was assigned to a new product - WebSPIRS - previously developed by the US-based development team. WebSPIRS suffered from huge performance problems and was becoming too unwieldy to develop and maintain.<br>
<br>
After carrying out some initial prototyping, I discovered new ways of improving performance and maintainability. Following the implementation of my recommendations, WebSPIRS performance increased on average by 84%.<br>
<br>
The development of the product continued after my departure from SilverPlatter and the product is still in production today.</p>

    <p class="description">The Leicester Mercury Group is a regional newspaper publisher based in the UK and part of the Northcliffe Newspapers Group which is owned by Daily Mail & General Trust plc.<br>
<br>
Working directly with the Deputy Managing Director, I developed the first online regional newspaper portal in the UK. This laid the foundation for the start of a much larger project to provide the regional press with a portal for its classified advertisements (AdHunter now re-branded as Fish 4), and a network of web sites for the local community (This is Britain).</p>
