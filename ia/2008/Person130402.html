    <p class="description">Futurology Business Advisors is the business name I use when I perform consulting work. Through my existing network of contacts and by attending trade shows, I have been able to secure several long term independent consulting contracts. In 2004, I helped Cellboost sell it's products into wireless carrier owned stores and in the retail channel as well. Signed a one year deal in 2005 with Ameriwood, a manufacturer of Ready To Assemble (RTA) furniture, to help them develop a line of products for the high end entertainment channel. I was successful at getting that product placed at both Circuit City and Best Buy. Currently I am working with a start up company that holds a license for the &quot;For Dummies&quot; brand and is trying to launch VoIP service to compete with Vonage in the retail channel. I am helping them identify and source products, nail down their message and consumer rate plans as well as taking the product to retailers once we are ready with our total package</p>

    <p class="description">I was recruited to GPX to help the company regain market share and profitability. I was re-united with a former supervisor from Sprint who had become CEO of the company. GPX had seen its overall business drop by greater than 40% in the two years prior to my coming on board. Working directly with the CEO; we were able to re-organize the entire company, improve efficiencies by reducing GS&amp;A by more than 15% and cull the number of factories we did business with in Asia and improving our terms with the remaining factories. We also were successful in developing and launching a new line up of products (118 SKU's) which helped us regain market share and profitability by increasing sales to existing customers and adding new customers like Wal-Mart, Circuit City and Target. In addition we positioned the company for sale and successfully sold it in April of 2004. As part of the consolidation of the new company I agreed to a buy out after a short transition period.</p>

This included the part time sales people we used to staff Best Buy and Circuit City on the weekends. By implementing a new stack rank procedure and coaching guidelines we were able to increase the efficiencies of these staffers by greater than 50%.
