            <h2>Doug Dawson&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I got my degree in Biology, looking to go into grad school and immunological research. But soon after graduation in 1991 my brother-in-law Phil, who had recently started a multimedia company, was having issues with a text-based database. Completely self-taught, I managed to whip up a few macros to streamline his process, and he offered me a job.<br>
<br>
In the sixteen years since, I have run a digital slide and imaging service bureau, established technology procedures for word processing and graphics departments for a major business outsource services provider, and trained folks in Photoshop and QuarkXpress production. <br>
<br>
I worked in a very cool video production house's multimedia department in St. Louis. It was with that company that I scored my highest award - a St. Louis Addy for "Interactive Disk - Based Sales Package" for Artex International. <br>
<br>
I then worked with a Flash-only firm called Chameleon Creative. That crew, brought together by Jeff Stein, was incredible. He and his partner sold at the top, and I moved on to join my long-time friends at Digital Solutions Laboratories. <br>
<br>
I also have tried to extend my knowledge and skills by stepping away from digital design and development. On September 12th, 2001, I told Curt and Shawn I was leaving DSLAB. <br>
<br>
I took a job as a mobile geochemist, driving a modified RV around Missouri. When that job was changed to be office-based, I went back to music and theater and began working with IATSE in St. Louis. That led to a gig with The Shakespeare Festival of St. Louis. <br>
<br>
Soon after that time I had begun to get an itch to get back to the field I truly knew best: digital design and development. Revitalized, refreshed, and with a new appreciation and viewpoint on the field, I am currently having a blast working with folks both young and old to make really cool stuff.

In addition I led the team that worked with the staff at a venerable private Chicago university through a discovery phase process to evaluate and revitalize their e-commerce offering.</p>

Worked on load-in, load-out and setup for shows by Metallica, Green Day, Destiny's Child, Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson, Weezer, and Sir Paul McCartney. Continued to learn about schedule intractability, coordinating vast numbers of diverse people on a common goal, and the importance of reusing and repackaging essential gear.</p>

It was an absolute blast, allowing a sense of accomplishment rarely felt through application development or online work; when 3,000 people burst out in applause at the end of the show, I took satisfaction in knowing that I had played a large role in making their evening enjoyable.</p>

    <p class="description">Hermon and Susan Atkinson and Wes Robb ran this mobile lab facility for some time before I talked my way on board. Convincing Hermon that I could indeed be a good field chemist, I quickly learned their process for running soil and water samples through EPA (modified) standards 8010 and 8020. I was soon on my own driving one of our two modified RV's to various locations around Missouri, testing soil and water for petroleum contamination. <br>
<br>
Missouri was enlightened enough to maintain a petroleum tank insurance fund, knowing that any tank buried within the ground would inevitably fail. The Fund would pay for our RV labs to be onsite and test soil and water as it was being removed to ensure that it was clean or dirty. I dug it. Unfortunately the DNR changed the regs in favor of fixed-base labs, and I decided on a change.<br>
<br>
I earned my Federal HAZWOPER Certification for this job and renewed for two more years; it has since lapsed.</p>

I worked on and off for them on contract jobs through the years, finally joining them in 2000 as a senior member of the company, which had grown to 45 people by then. Essentially I was a project manager, multimedia team leader, and salesman at this web application development company.

    <p class="description">Jeff Stein was (and still is) one of the most dynamic guys I know. After I had worked with him on contract for some multimedia development jobs, he offered me a position as a project manager. I gladly accepted, but left on good terms 8 months later when he sold the company to Kupper Parker.</p>

    <p class="description">After working with Abe Siemsen and Bob Miano in a contractor role, I was offered a full-time job. Great place, with great projects including Artex International, Mitek, Mastercard, and more. Really cut my teeth on video compression here. Also won the 1998 St. Louis Addy for Best Interactive Disk-Based Sales Package for Artex International. I also received honorary mention for my Monsanto CD-ROM. Left in the fall of 1999, young and foolish.</p>

With folks like Anne Ford, Tom Munro, Kari Auringer, David Lawrence, and Linda herself, we turned the client around to the point where they were asking us for word processing and graphics production advice. My company phonebook listing read "Systems Analyst/God". I always thought that was cool.</p>

Our main client was RR Donnelley and Sons and its subsidiary Mobium. Our two big projects for them were TandyVision for Radio Shack, and a marketing laptop-based presentation for Avon. These experiences have guided my career choices ever since.</p>
