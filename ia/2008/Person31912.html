            <h2>Cathy Brooks&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I guess you could say it was fate. With nicknames ranging from Chatty Cathy to Babbling Brooks, and my family tendencies, you could say that I'm a genetically engineered communicator. The business connector part came later. While I've spent some time in and around PR/Marketing firms, my core experience lies on the media side of the communications fence. In my current iteration, I am focused on producing content for various platforms - largely conferences and events, but also including podcasts and other interviews.<br>
<br>
Most recently I was engaged by European entrepreneur, Loic Le Meur, to develop and produce the program for his fourth annual LeWeb conference in Paris.<br>
<br>
Another current client is Guidewire Group, a market intelligence firm focused  wholly on emerging markets, technologies and companies - anyone and everyone who's involved in the innovation ecosystem. My role is developing and producing two events for this organizations (Innovate!Europe and Leadership Forum), as well as an ongoing podcast  - I of Innovation - an in-depth interview series that profiles the entrepreneurs who build companies and the people who invest in them. <br>
<br>
Immediately prior to this role I had the perfect job for polishing my psychological analysis skills - heading Business Development in the Bay Area for one of the largest PR firms in the US. I've spent some other hands-on time in PR and marketing, but mostly my career is comprised by time in newsrooms in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami and San Francisco. Primarily a broadcaster, I have a degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.<br>
<br>
My technology-focused work lives on-line at http://www.guidewiregroup.com<br>
<br>
Everything "other than that" lives on-line at http://www.otherthanthat.com. <br>
<br>
I'm interested in talking with people of all ilk - especially if they have an interesting story to tell.

The fourth iteration of this event, this year's LeWeb3 conference gathered 2,000 people from 40 countries - a group comprised by Europe's most influential bloggers, media and others who are driving technology. My role is identifying themes and topics for the conference, selecting the speakers to address those topics, book the speakers and then help Loic emcee the event. This year we had more than 110 speakers. I also selected the Start-up Competition at this year's LeWeb for which we selected more than 30 companies to participate.</p>

    <p class="description">Guidewire is a global market intelligence firm focused wholly on emerging markets, companies, technologies and products. Led by Chris Shipley - technology industry pundit, journalist and executive producer of the DEMO conference - Guidewire serves as an ally to entrepreneurs and guide to those who invest in them. We kicked off 2007 by launching the Guidewire Report - a bi-weekly subscription newsletter providing in-depth analysis of key trends we are seeing, and including profiles of companies with which we've met that fit into that trend. TGR includes a   map outlining the taxonomy of the segment and shows where each company fits in relation to the market and to each other. <br>
<br>
I produced the content for Guidewire's conferences and also launched their first podcast series, I of Innovation. That show ended in July 2007 and evolved into a series currently run by Network World on the DEMO site called "Six Minutes With".</p>

    <p class="description">At TechTV I was responsible for any person who appeared in front of the camera - whether interviewer or interviewee. I began running both parts, towards the end of my time at TechTV, my focus moved wholly to  guests - no mean feat since we were securing more than 20 unique, live guests for programming every day.<br>
<br>
When I started there was one full-time and one part-time booker. By the end of my tenure the department was 15 bookers strong, working from several offices.<br>
<br>
My biggest challenge was educating the public about TechTV in order to secure interviews with some of the biggest names in technology. During my time with TechTV we intervewed Craig Barrett of Intel, Steve Wozniak one of Apple's co-founders, Nathan Myhrvold one of Microsoft's early technology leaders and many more. <br>
<br>
At TechTV I strengthened my belief on the importance of teamwork and honed my practice of deep engagement with people at all levels of the organization.</p>
