I have won premierships with Burwood Briars in First Grade in 1984/85 as captain, in Second Grade in 1995/96 and in Third Grade in 1998/99. However, I am yet to win a Fourth grade competition, having finished 2nd, 3rd, 2nd, 3rd in my past four seasons as captain. It might have something to do with the captain overbowling his off-spinners.</p>

    <p class="description">Since 1990 Greg Wallace has crafted a career at the cutting edge of developments in global equities markets.<br>
<br>
As a quantitative analyst he achieved broad recognition for being able to convey his complex, creative ideas in a simple way. His work on Improving the Investment Process was the cornerstone of him being rated no. 1 Quantitative Analyst in Australia in the mid-to-late 1990s. In this series he published his first market impact model in 1995.<br>
<br>
As a result of his ideas of Improving the Process Greg’s role broadened from quant research into risk arbitrage, electronic distribution of research, website development, index research, program trading and execution research.</p>

Scored my first-ever century in my first game as captain, later scored a second one and scored over 500 runs for the season. Led team for a record 33 games without loss over first two seasons as captain. Used captain's perogative to overbowl my leg-spinners.</p>
