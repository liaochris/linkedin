            <h2>Nick Zart&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Currently studying with CoachU for my ICF accreditation, I am living the best time of my life as a Business & Life Coach.<br>
<br>
The biggest part of my career life was spent training, languages at first, then computer which led to setting up networks.  My consulting career focused on figuring what my clients really wanted and matching them with the right professionals.<br>
<br>
I've worked closely with small and mid-size companies, entrepreneurs and freelance consultants, understanding their needs and budgets, their structures and motivations.  I owned a few small businesses, the last one in New York City where I associated with other consultants to build a highly successful team.  I understand what both small companies and consultants are looking for, having been in both visions and aligning them with most of my business life.  I felt most comfortable figuring out company's visions and aligning them with what they needed to make it happen.  The most rewarding part of my career was listening to my clients, understanding their needs, getting the right people for the job, and determining a plan of action.<br>
<br>
Working in real estate gives me a greater understanding of individual's needs and how they ask for them.  It has helped me feel people's dreams and visions.  It takes a lot of listening, asking the right questions and getting to the source.  Working in real estate has cemented my faith in high ethics.  I am lucky to work with an amazing team of highly dedicated professionals.<br>
<br>
I thought I had been coaching people throughout my work experience until I took my first level of coaching at CoachU.  Now I understand what coaching is (and isn't) and I am excited to start my coaching practice.  Coaching is so much more subtle than any of the consulting or advising work I have done.  I look forward to building a healthy practice this year.  I finally found my calling.
              </p>

    <p class="description">I have a successful coaching practice here in Long Beach.  I work with dynamic entrepreneurs and small business owners.  I am a student at CoachU where I have just graduated from my first level and working towards my ACC from the International Coaching Federation.   I feel being accredited by the International Coaching Federation and CoachU makes a huge difference in the quality of my services.  Coaching is the most rewarding and fulfilling way of life I am privileged to experience.<br>
<br>
I coach mostly successful and motivated entrepreneurs and small business owners to run efficient staffs and achieve long term strategies.  I really enjoy working with dynamic people.  It's contagious!  Helping them achieve greater levels of success, greater sense of awareness and paving the future gives me an incredible sense of well being.  There is something amazing about being there for these "Ah ha!" moments.<br>
<br>
It is all about you and what you want, not what you have been told to do.</p>

    <p class="description">I was an agent with the famous Robert Weil Associates team in Long Beach, California.  The company has been around for over three decades where agents work on a verage 18 years, some as far back as 30 years.<br>
<br>
It's hard to describe this company.  Friendly, honest, ethical, a great bunch of professional who fights to buy coffee for everyone?  A rare and precious jewel in an industry known for its back stabbing.<br>
<br>
Robert Weil Associates has closed its doors on December 2007 due to the rocky high end real estate market.</p>

    <p class="description">I started this company with two referrals in 1998 and ended with an impressive portfolio.  I had great clients, including Tom Wolfe, Wynne Miller (Glen Miller's niece) as well as small to mid-size companies implementing, designing and maintaining their IT structure.<br>
<br>
It was probably my biggest challenge and remains some of my best, but toughest memories.<br>
<br>
I met incredible people, lost money to some very unethical partners and clients but overall, I still get calls from clients saying they miss the days when I took care of them.  That is unbeatable.</p>

    <p class="description">Another amazing experience while living in Japan.  Part of the United Nation, the World Craft Council set out to digitize and catalog crafts around the world so that local cultures were recognized as the originators.  <br>
<br>
I was in charge of the IT infrastructure and translations from French to English and vice-versa, as well helping set up the Kyoto conference of 1996.<br>

    <p class="description">What can I say about this amazing experience.  Not knowing a word of Japanese, I set out for Kyoto where I was taken on to update an aging IT infrastructure.  New computers needed to be purchased and networked to other centers throughout Japan.<br>
<br>
I taught a few classes and was also responsible for updating the pedagogical tools.<br>
<br>
A great time but very tough, as I had to work with people who still feared computers were taking over.</p>

<br>
It was very fulfilling but the lure of Japan was too strong to pass.  I was young and looking for growth.  I had maxed out any potential growth.</p>
