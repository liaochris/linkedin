              <p class="summary">
                My experience in business and project management aids me in developing organizational standards for myself in any new position that I encounter. It also educated me on the meaning of teamwork and to understand that it뭩 the whole that makes progress. I learned valuable management, marketing, and financial skills that I now implement in my web-developing and management career. I am most interested in combining my education, management experience, and design skills to fulfill such responsibilities as:<br>
<br>
 Motivating, developing, and educating project managers and team members.<br>
 Developing strong relationships with clients and resolving project issues.<br>
 Providing strategic consulting services to the client executives and assuming the role of internal client advocate, therefore ensuring client satisfaction.<br>
 Managing multiple functional teams.<br>
 Determining staffing/team structure for new clients and projects.<br>
 Allocating resources appropriately and ensuring employee satisfaction.<br>
 Maintaining project profitability through all phases of the Client Project lifecycle; including assessment, preliminary design, package evaluation, detailed design, programming functionality, installation, systems testing, user testing, customer support services, and fees collections.<br>
 Ensuring successful delivery of project in conjunction with Project Managers and Team Members.<br>
<br>
Having over ten years of design/development experience and experience with top-notch programs in the field allow me to successfully complete full designs promptly and efficiently. I have beginning knowledge of ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, PHP and CGI web programming technologies. Understanding the basic methodologies of these programming elements makes me the perfect median between developers and internal business clients.
