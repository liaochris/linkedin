              <p class="summary">
                Experience Summary:<br>
A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, EXECUTIVE-LEVEL SALES MANAGER AT LEADING COMPANIES SUCH AS: iCONTACT, RED HAT, CISCO, SAMSUNG, NEC AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS.  ALSO STARTED OWN CARTRIDGE WORLD BUSINESS.<br>
<br>
I am an accomplished sales manager, demonstrated by my 20 year record of leading successful organizations that consistently increase sales and exceed quotas.  In addition, I have been instrumental in starting up sales teams and forming alliances that result in an efficient, low-cost blend of Field, Inside and Partner Sales.    I specialize in re-engineering sales teams using tools employing state-of-the-art technology.  <br>
<br>
Due to the necessity of using strategic sales methods to sell highly complex products into large organizations, I have implemented proven interviewing procedures and techniques to hire high caliber technical sales reps. As part of implementing new sales teams, I have demonstrated that intensive sales and product training programs not only bring new sales reps up to speed quickly, but also continue to sharpen their skills. <br>
<br>
In addition, at Cisco and Red Hat, I was instrumental in developing sales data mining systems that accurately identified top and target accounts, uncovered customer and product tendencies, and automatically measured individual and product sales.    Premier companies like Cisco, Red Hat, Samsung, NEC and Texas Instruments have trusted me to lead teams selling products as diverse as Networking, Linux Solutions, Open Source Software and Semiconductors into every major market utilizing high- technology solutions. Employers see consistently superior results under my management, which I accomplish using a scientific method to sell more of the right products to the best customers, while identifying the top salespeople.
