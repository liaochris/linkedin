            <h2>Mark Hughes&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have always been passionate about inspirational design, sound engineering and precision manufacturing.<br>
Now, after relocating and a lot of hard work I am pleased to announce that my company is established and in business here in the Czech Republic.<br>
Prague was chosen as the seat of the business for a few reasons:<br>
It is 'steeped' in history and well known for it's beauty. Therefore it is a perfect place for your business trip that can be combined with a first class sight seeing tour. Not to mention the first class beer and such good value.<br>
In the future we will be able to offer accommodation, however right now the house is under construction. Having said this, there are numerous excellent hotels.<br>
The city with a population of about one point two million is perfectly located geographically in the heart of Europe. It also boasts a first class infrastructure and Prague international airport is served by connections with a vast majority of locations on earth. All this combined with a healthy economy, need I say more?<br>
There is actually one more thing that I would like to mention. Although the economy is healthy the average wage is still relatively low, thus enabling CZ to remain very competitive.<br>

Dana and Mark are passionate for the best things in life. Devoting lot's of energy to enhancing life in any and every way.<br>
Currently we're working with creative and highly skilled craft persons in the Czech Republic to reach a wider audience, most of whom have been limited to the CZ market due to language barriers.<br>
DaMaHug is keen to investigate and develop products with enthusiastic designers, engineers and inventors. Do you remember a 'eureka' moment but simply didn't have the time to make it a reality. Maybe now is the time?<br>
The Czech Republic has a healthy economy and is set for a bright future in the European Community. It's geographic location alone is a big bonus. Add to this, the skilled craft persons, the infrastructure, competitiveness.<br>
The present is exciting, the future..... let's make the future fantastic!<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

The customer a well known Truck manufacturer. The purpose of the station to produce finished welded transmission hub assemblies. Large, heavy assemblies involving a lot of heat from the large puddle welds.<br>
Dave &amp; I looked at the existing system, looked at some proposals and then turned the whole concept on it's head and created an indexing system that controlled from underneath. This deleted the need of large water cooling systems and streamlined the whole process.</p>

    <p class="description">With the experience of Volvo Trucks very much in my mind I accepted a job offer back at Volvo cars but with rather sad feeling in my heart.<br>
At this time the future of the Automotive industry was not looking particularly bright.<br>
When it came to the traditional four week semester holiday I decided to throw all caution to the wind and see where life would take me.<br>
Reluctantly I closed the life that I had spent quite a few years and lots of effort to create.</p>

Two days into this exciting time came a phone call from a friend of mine in Cars. He said that he had heard a rumour of the project that I was working on being 'shelved'....<br>
Two more days of rumours flying and it then was made official.<br>
Mmmmmm....... me thinks.... is this really the future???</p>

    <p class="description">The Rear End tailgate period was, as with all placements in Volvo an excellent time. I worked along Side a French Gemtleman called Eric Laborderie. The worshipful Eric loved the game of Table football of which I had in my apartment. However, he would not consider a game unless I had proper competition balls. Eric came back after one of his weekend trips to France with a set of the afore mentioned.<br>
Game on! I was so scared when he performed moves on my table that I had never, even in my wildest dreams thought possible.<br>
It all ended in tears when...... well, I will keep the secret safe Eric.</p>

    <p class="description">Front end structure. The union feel consultants should not become part of the furniture, a perfectly reasonable policy.<br>
Volvo still have a project to complete on time to remain competitive in the ruthless arena of the automotive industry.<br>
Consultants would be located at their respective agents sites. My agent had just moved into new premises created by the transformation of a former 'Ship Building' yard into an inspiring complex, complete with Sea Gull recorded cries every two minutes on the glass roof to scare the real ones away.<br>
An office was set up for consultants. A cosy little tucked away mezzanine overlooking the studio plate.<br>
Our team leader Tom Stoddart would visit us from Volvo, often close to lunchtime.<br>
Twas a masterpiece of logistical planning.<br>

To interpret, translate and ultimately find the common ground between Design and Engineering. An extremely rewarding role but can also be quite tough at times. It has it's ups and downs.<br>
This is when I met my wife to be. Well, it could have been Isabela Hughes but it wasn't to be. Isabela and I had been planning things by way of what would be in the contract of marriage.<br>
I was allowed several girls but they all must have a skill, like gardening for example. In turn Isabela would have two dogs.<br>
We would only have one car, this way she would know where I was.<br>
Then there was a Volvo Party. They can be very wild events and this was no exception.<br>
Consequently the wedding was off.<br>
Diego Imaz is name that I must mention, if I have enough space left.<br>
We worked together, we partied together and are still jolly good friends.<br>
There is now some km between us but when my business ramps up I will be inventing business trips to wherever he will be, Mexico?</p>

    <p class="description">Many fond memories of this time. In this period of time computers where of course well established as the way to design cars. Further to this the crash simulations that computers could handle were becoming progressively more powerful. Granted it took the computer all night to have the result ready for examining the following day, but it was very exciting to receive the phone call (still with a wire) from the calculations engineer to say and have a look at the results.</p>

    <p class="description">CATIA was becoming very established with CADAM still available for reference.<br>
It was my first time in Sweden and inspirational.<br>
I arrived 3rd Jan on the Stenaline ferry in a front Cabin with window and wow! I thought that white plastic bags were in the water, then realising it was ice.<br>
The picture of Sweden that had been painted mentally for me by Nick Bright and Steve O'Shawnasey was grim. Dark, depressing, ques everywhere. My expectations were low.<br>
Leaving the ferry I drove to Volvo it was beautiful, snow everywhere. Lots more I would like to say but not enough space here.<br>
My task was to develop a gas injected meter hood. The incorporation of 'Gas Injection' into the injection moulding process is a wonderful way of substantially increasing the strength of a component. It does demand careful planning and design and liaison with the tooling company.<br>
The end result was superb. The first part produced was perfect and presented to Volvo by the French supplier on my last day.</p>

    <p class="description">Agent working for the worshipful IAD of Worthing with John Shute at the helm.<br>
First class company. Almost too first class really. The speed of growth was fast, maybe this was the fundamental problem. It was a great company that assisted my training well for the future, for which I will be eternally grateful.</p>

    <p class="description">This was when CAD came into the picture. The system was called Graftek GMS and all the computers were placed in a special room with no windows.<br>
For the first time I really felt that this was it I had arrived at the job that I would retire from.<br>
During this time I didn't actually have another child but one did become 'on the way'.<br>
My very special friendship with Sietse Roeda from North Netherlands came about here. Sietse and I were working together on the development of the same special machinery. Sietse was on 'work experience' from his Dutch College.<br>
We worked well together and would also enjoy a good party in Brighton. Sietse also introduced me to his now wife Anita in Metal Box and the two of us toured Anita around the factory. Great memories!<br>
My plan of retirement was shattered when a French company took over and decided to move the operation to Coventry.<br>
That was the last time I joined the 'company' pension system.<br>
Steve Judd used to say to me when at Singer. 'Go contract'</p>
