            <h2>Scott Allen&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Five quick facts about Scott Allen:<br>
- Scott Allen is a social media and social networking consultant, author and speaker.<br>
- Scott Allen is uncomfortable writing about himself in the third person,<br>
- But Scott Allen likes coming up at the top of search results for his name,<br>
- And Scott Allen also likes experimenting with LinkedIn and other social networking sites,<br>
- So Scott Allen sometimes does peculiar things with his profile. :-)<br>
<br>
Now that I've appeased the search engine...<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, I was a social media and social networking guy before they were called that. I taught my first online networking workshop in December 2002!<br>
<br>
My great passion is helping people build business relationships online. In that regard, I am:<br>
- Coauthor, "The Virtual Handshake: Opening Doors and Closing Deals Online"<br>
- Coauthor, "The Emergence of The Relationship Economy"<br>
- Executive Editor, Happy About LinkedIn Series, including Jason Alba's "I'm on LinkedIn -- Now What??"<br>
- Contributing author, "Blog!: How the Newest Media Revolution Is Changing Politics, Business and Culture"<br>
- Monthly columnist for FastCompany.com.<br>
<br>
I also:<br>
- Consult with companies on how to leverage social networking for sales, marketing, and business development<br>
- Teach workshops and teleclasses on the topic<br>
- Deliver keynote addresses or program sessions on the topic<br>
<br>
My co-authors and I also provide a wealth of free resources through The Virtual Handshake Blog and our e-newsletter. See TheVirtualHandshake.com for more info.<br>
<br>
I also have twenty years of experience as a technology executive, entrepreneur, and consultant and am currently the Entrepreneurs Guide at About.com, a subsidiary of The New York Times Company.

Following some reorganization, I shifted to the position of Knowledge Management Practice Manager, focusing on clients for whom knowledge management was their primary purpose for implementing a portal.

    <p class="description">As senior developer, I led the team of programmers working on the inbound telemarketing system and lead referral and tracking system for Harte-Hanks' client, IBM. Harte-Hanks developed BPOPS, a web-based application for business partner referrals used by both Harte-Hanks and IBM employees and partners. By improving the existing code architecture and training my team, I was able to reduce the team size from a peak of 10 down to 4 when I changed roles (don't worry -- they all went to work on something else within the company!).</p>
