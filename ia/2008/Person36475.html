    <p class="description">The North West Equality and Diversity Group (NWEDG) was created in 2004 to help develop the region's Equality and Diversity Strategy. After extensive consultation that strategy was adopted by the regional assembly, regional development agency and Government Office, and is regarded by them as a key enabler of the region's economic strategy. The group's role has correspondingly shifted to a monitoring function and acting as a critical friend -- ensuring that the regional agencies each fulfil their parts of the plan to actualise the strategy.<br>
<br>
As chair my role extends beyond straighforward leadership of the group and its agenda. One responsibility is to meet regularly with the directors of the three regional agencies, as an "Equality Strategy Group" to review the achievement of the plan. Following the arrival of the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights the NWEDG is ideally placed to act as an interface with the region's many stakeholders.</p>

    <p class="description">This role is currently under change as we work to reshape the body. Until November 2007 I was chair of the transgender workstream. The workstreams are now suspended, but the chairs remain members of the national steering group (NSG) during the change process.<br>
<br>
As chair of this interdisciplinary committee it was my responsibility to coordinate activity with the chairs of two other committees to recommend investment of £250K (2007/8) on projects to promote the inclusion of LGBT people throughout Britain's health and social care services.<br>
<br>
My committee of 15 included roughly equal numbers of patient group representatives, medical professionals / commissioners and diversity leads from other government departments.<br>
<br>
Successes include commissioning two research projects and publication of a series of DH/NHS booklets.</p>

Challenges successfully met included the elimination of almost £1M of problematic debt in the sales ledgers when I began work for the previous owner; and the setting up of a system to effectively manage the benefit income and expenditure budgetting for more than 50 tenants, with ongoing responsibilty for over £350K of client funds.<br>

    <p class="description">I was headhunted in 1982 to join this startup computer systems and services company set up by S&W Berisford PLC. My role there was to advise the Managing Director on emerging technologies to incorporate into the offering.<br>
<br>
At the end of 1983 the board of S&W Berisford decided that an IT services company was not something they wished to retain in their business portfolio. Having made that decision they then decided to offer the senior staff the opportunity to buy out the goodwill and set up in trade for ourselves.<br>
<br>
Successes included developing the first ever computerised scoring system for the Miss World competition in conjunction with Eric Morley and the show's sponsors, Epson UK Ltd. Also began developing an innovative range of applications to exploit the unique capabilities of the portable A4 size computers which Epson developed. These portables were years before the emergence of today's laptops.</p>
