            <h2>Ken Hogan, PMP&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                As a self-employed PMP certified Sr. Project Manager, I managed the implementation of several complex mission critical multi-phased projects, including but not limited to, Long Distance Network solution implementations, Competitive Local Exchange Carrier solutions, Customer Care infrastructure enhancements and Reservations and Ticketing systems replacements.<br>
<br>
In the past I've sub-contracted members of my team’s services out to various organizations as sub-contractors, which allowed me to perform sales, estimating, project management and collections duties. I also gained considerable knowledge and experience in the following areas: <br>
•	Successfully managed multiple projects concurrently and completed all projects on time and within budget <br>
•	Supervised, trained and mentored developers, project managers and peers in areas of software development, solution architecture, project and program management <br>
•	Gained considerable knowledge of the PMI Project Management Methodology through first hand application of the best practices as a member of the technical team and as an instructor at a local community college while preparing students for PMP certification. <br>
<br>
Additionally, my qualifications include:<br>
•	A Bachelor of Science in Math with a minor in Education<br>
•	Proficiency as a COBOL OS MVS Software Developer<br>
•	J2EE Software Development Manager<br>
•	PMI Certified Project Management Professional with the ability to use tools such as Microsoft Enterprise Server Project Management, Microsoft Business Suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, Access, VISIO), and more.  <br>
<br>
Throughout my career, I have fostered a reputation for being a very hard-working, intelligent, and industrious individual. My motivation is to completely utilize my accumulated experience and knowledge to the fullest extent possible.
