              <p class="summary">
                - Artistic Experience -<br>
As a fine artist, I have developed a body of work over several years that includes drawings, paintings, prints and some sculpture. My preferred mediums are oil and acrylic paint, watercolor, charcoal and ink. I have shown in both Seattle and New York, currently represented by La Familia Gallery in Pioneer Square, Seattle. Visit my portfolio website to learn more about my art at www.ingridalvarez.com.<br>
<br>
- Creative Marketer Experience -<br>
My work as an independent contractor is targeted for individuals or companies that are interested in fusing their current marketing with new and social media. I evaluate existing marketing and branding in order to develop strategic solutions for online marketing, promotion and increased exposure. By using effective composition and great attention to detail, I've developed as a graphic designer. Writing and reading about art, media and technology are also passions of mine. <br>
<br>
- Creative Marketing Development -<br>
Previously, I was working for RE/MAX Mutual Realty in Ballard (Seattle) for about two and a half years, responsible for marketing, advertising, IT and networking. In addition to consulting the CEO, managing our website, online advertising, creating and sending the newsletter, I introduced the office to blogging for business. Developing and managing the company blog encouraged me to educate others to do the same for their business. <br>
<br>
Soon I was hosting and leading classes and workshops on blogging for business, as well as co-teaching with other independent professionals. Other educational events included topics such as keywords, SEO/SEM, online networking with social media profiles and using software such as Adobe Photoshop.
