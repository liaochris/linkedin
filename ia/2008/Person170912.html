    <p class="description">Retained by this insurance company very early in the project lifecycle to help gather requirements for a time entry and tracking application for its 14,000 employees, and build it if necessary. As requirement gathering progressed, it became apparent the best way for Humana to achieve its goals would be to acquire existing software from an outside vendor. With in-house development for that project unnecessary, I stepped in and helped retrofit an existing time entry application adding FMLA-required functionality, and rapidly developed a thinly-defined intranet site used to kick off its new succession management process.</p>

Work was focused around two projects: a reporting function used by ACBL’s clients that performed poorly, and a web-based HR application for acquiring and tracking job applications. The barge reporting function was rebuilt to reduce execution time from 15 seconds to less than 1 second and allow it to better scale to the client’s needs. HR function required re-engineering to simplify and streamline the application process.</p>

    <p class="description">At the time I joined the 50-person team building Louisville Gas & Electric’s multi-million dollar commodity-trading application, I became the third consultant to attempt to build its accounting functions. I arrived with no experience in Oracle and was asked to build the most complex Oracle packages and queries. The challenges arose from extremely complex requirements, a multi-terabyte database, and very optimistic performance goals. Over the course of several months, a project lead with extensive accounting system experience, a dedicated front-end developer and I worked closely with the accounting team to learn its needs. We proceeded to design and build functions around the existing system achieving the accounting team’s goals.</p>

Performed system-wide analysis to help define and document application requirements. Re-architected and rewrote application code to make it more maintainable and malleable. Through this process, the ASP code base was simplified and reduced in size by 30-percent. Business logic originally performed by Microsoft SQL 7.0 stored procedures was moved into a COM and ASP business layer reducing SQL stored procedure code size by 50-percent. This process allowed the frequent changes required by this company to be made in one-third the previous time and with minimal impact on the application as a whole.</p>

This process required a rewrite of 80-percent of the application’s code reducing its size by 40-percent while including the additional functionality. I was retained for an additional five months to develop a second version and assisted in converting the application’s database from Microsoft SQL 6.5 to Microsoft SQL 7.0.</p>

    <p class="description">As a member of Microsoft’s e-store team, I was given the opportunity to work on Microsoft’s two largest internal e-commerce projects at that time. My primary responsibility was as an ASP and D-HTML developer for the Microsoft Open License program site, Microsoft Licensing On-Line (MLO). Working as a small team with one other developer, I also helped architect and build the user-authentication system for Microsoft’s e-commerce flagship, shop.Microsoft.com. I was given the opportunity to stay permanently with Microsoft but decided to return to my hometown of Louisville, KY.</p>
