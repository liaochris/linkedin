            <h2>Dale Williams&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am an Executive Coach and Business MacGyver* retired from corporate life and currently on sabatical actively exploring new opportunities.<br>
<br>
My future work interests lie in three areas:<br>
1. Support for entrepreneurial opportunities that require investment. <br>
2. Consulting opportunities requiring an accountable person to deliver well-defined business outcomes. <br>
3. Executive coaching.<br>
<br>
My previous roles included heading up Standard Chartered's Retail Bank in South Africa and as an entrepreneur who with my partners sold our company at the height of the 1990's technology boom.<br>
<br>
I have been running an Executive Coaching Practice since 2002 focused on leaders within large corporations and entreprenuers facing the challenges of their own business. I completed my (MA) in Executive Coaching through Middlesex University in 2005.<br>
<br>
Clem Sunter [Chairman of Anglo American Chairman's Fund] noted that my thesis [see below] is "a unique application of the methodology of Scenario Planning; but the idea of looking at the future through a prism of possibilities is as relevant to an individual as to a business."<br>
<br>
I have a strong belief that organisations are only as good as the people that they nurture. Healthy and functional relationships within an organisation are key to its financial success.<br>
<br>
My coaching and consulting work with companies combine practical successes in this area with my academic learning.<br>
<br>
When consulting I believe that the only way my assignment can be successful is to have direct accountability for well defined business critical deliverables. Writing a report or presenting a powerpoint doesn't cut it nor adds value to the business.<br>
<br>
I am keen to take on challenges with<br>
1. new businesses,<br>
2. organisations going through change and<br>
3. with individuals who believe they would benefit from coaching.<br>
<br>
* Urban Dictionary Definition of MacGyver: "To use ingenuity to fix or remedy a problem using only the tools available at hand."

    <p class="description">Thesis title: Exploring the effect of the scenario building process in creating personal change and its application in the coaching context<br>
_<br>
Quote from Clem Sunter, Chairman Anglo American Chairman's Fund:<br>
"This is a unique application of the methodology of Scenario Planning; but the idea of looking at the future through a prism of possibilities is as relevant to an individual as to a business."<br>
<br>
My coaching framework uses scenario planning as a basis for working with personal change and development. The processes used are similar to those  techniques [Anglo's high road and low road] that paved the way for significant change in South Africa. <br>
<br>
During the Mont Fleur scenario building exercise in 1992 key role players in the current national government changed their mental models as a result of the scenarios. Contact me for a summarised copy of my thesis.</p>

Co-ran the international student exchange program where we placed approximately 5,000 students at organisations around the world.<br>

      <p class="notes">My thesis was "Exploring the effect of the scenario building process in creating personal change and its application in the coaching context".<br>
<br>
Clem Sunter, director of Anglo American Chairman's Fund said this about my work, "This is a unique application of the methodology of Scenario Planning; but the idea of looking at the future through a prism of possibilities is as relevant to an individual as to a business."<br>
<br>
This is the first piece of research on Personal Scenario coaching, and being exploratory in nature, brings together the main issues, successes and challenges of this approach. <br>
<br>
The scenario building process is expansive, exciting, fun and has the ability to significantly influence the mental models of participants directly leading to an improved ability to grapple with difficult problems.</p>
