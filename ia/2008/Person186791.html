    <p class="description">A few of us have decided that it was time to start a Detroit Metro area, linkedin centric yahoo! group.  It operates under the name of motorcityconnect.<br>
<br>
The purpose of it is to have Detroit area professionals connect with one another while allowing the rest of the world to connect us.<br>
<br>
The forum itself is a place where we can network, learn and share with one another.  If you are interested in being a member, look us up here:<br>

The Secret impacted me because it did such a great job of explaining what I have known to be true for a long time.  It has created an awareness that has been really needed.  I am happy to see this awakening and am blessed to play any part in it.<br>

    <p class="description">This was great conceptually.  Unfortunately, we were long on ideas and a little short on implementation.  Not having cash is always a killer.  We built a CLEC that went from zero to a profitable sale in less than 28 months. We partnered with non-profit organizations and gave them a unique fund-raising opportunity through the sale of phone service.  It was fun, good people and I learned some new things about both telco and myself.</p>

    <p class="description">Helped end users make informed purchasing decisions as it pertained to phone service, internet connections and data storage/hosting.  I had always held the view that I wasn't cut out for the corporate world.  This position was as close to it as I got.  I was there during the tech burst and we were hit hard.  I learned and taught a lot of corporate finance.  Of course, had I an interest in that, I would have learned about it outside of my sales career.</p>

    <p class="description">Learned about Telecom and was reminded why I prefer to network as opposed to cold calling.  This job was a doosy.  The whole bust hit smaller companies before the larger ones (no kidding, tell us more Dr. finance).  This little entity had a cool website and showed some promise as a national provider.  What you didn't know until you got there is that unless you were in one of 6 markets (go figure, Detroit wasn't one of them) they were basically selling Long Distance.  I wanted to sell VPN, hosting and Frame Relay, not quite the same thing.  I also learned how to not manage people.  Thanks CF.</p>

    <p class="description">My firm networked other staffing firms in Columbus, Ohio to be able find/fill jobs quickly and correctly.  Loves this job and the concept.  In fact, as I have gotten back into recruiting, I have started networking recruiters again.  Too many times recruiters have the right job or the right candidate.  My thought has always been that 50% is better than 0%,  It always struck me as odd when others didn't see it that way.  Oh well, their loss.</p>

      <p class="notes">Selected for a Graduate Assistantship that allowed me to teach CTA 124.  This was one of only 4 mandatory classes at E.M.U.  It's kind of cool to get to try out a career at someone else's expense.  I enjoyed the teaching, not so much the planning or the grading.  It was interesting to teach people that were significantly older than I.  Ran into a couple of people that didn't care for my humor.  Actually, I don't know how much I would care for the humor that I possessed at 23.  Oh who am I kidding, I still I think I am funny.</p>

      <p class="notes">I quickly discovered that U of M was about 12 minutes away from E.M.U.  Although I didn't have the grades to be accepted, I certainly had the wit.  I enjoyed spending time in A2.  I took a position as a bouncer in a bar and got promoted up through to management.  Bartending was one of my best experiences in life.  Met  a lot of good people and enjoyed the exchanges.  Good food, good drinks, good friends, good times.  RIP O'sullivan's c.(1988-1995)</p>
