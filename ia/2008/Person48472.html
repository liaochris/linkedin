<br>
I have been involved in recruitment since the fall of 2000 having enjoyed recruiting for multiple disciplines. I have experienced the advantages of retained, contingent, corporate recruitment, and now technical staffing!<br>
<br>
I believe that the team is only as strong as the newest member so the idea of knowledge transfer is mandatory for proper succession planning. I have been able to adapt to the following models: contract, contract to hire, corporate as well as long term consultancy arrangements for hard to find and sought after skill sets through out the Washington DC market as well as for the national basis for a select few industries.

              <p class="skills">
                I am very familiar with employment law as well as candidate attraction. Some of my successful methods of attracting the passive candidate are by networking through user groups, direct referrals, social networking as well as cold calling. I have extensive experience creating staffing game plans to identify areas for improvement while maximizing expectations for ROI for the end user or client.
