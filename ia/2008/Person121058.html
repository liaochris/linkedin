            <h2>Marilyn McNeal&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                In New York, I taught at The Fund for The City of New York, The Technology & Learning Center, Jacob Riis Settlement House, The Borough of Manhattan Community College, Long Island University, and the Computer Instruction Center at The New School University.<br>
<br>
Currently, I am teaching Photoshop and Flash at the Downtown and John Adams campuses of City College of San Francisco. In June 2007, I began teaching at Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC).<br>
<br>
I have MOUS certification in Word, Excel, Access, Outlook and PowerPoint and provide training on a contract basis.<br>
<br>
METHODOLOGY<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in helping students develop cross application digital literacy. By providing a clear conceptual overview followed by step-by-step instruction and materials, I help students develop a strong foundation in digital media production essentials.<br>
<br>
To augment this process, I often create instructional materials on the spot, first showing, then typing up instructions that convey what was just demonstrated. This is extremely difficult to do but well worth the effort because it offers students a critical bridge between the language they hear, the language they need to repeat to themselves, and the actions associated with the language.<br>
<br>
Finally, I emphasize problem solving. I think it is vital that students learn how to figure things out using online resources, experimentation and common sense. Most students will not have the luxury of being in an instructor-led environment all of the time. I speak to that reality and encourage their discovery and research skills from the very first class.
