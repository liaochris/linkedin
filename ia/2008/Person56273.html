            <h2>Eddy Kindermans&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                " Ne spekkewinkel" , " A candy store", that's how a West-Flemish entrepreneur reacted when he saw the different offerings on the back of my business card. <br>
<br>
Yes, I write convincing texts AND professional screenplays AND direct videos or tv programs AND design (not in the graphical way) usable websites AND teach all those things to others...<br>
<br>
Everything I do is about COMMUNICATION between people: getting the message across from A to B. It can be a story, a product, an attitude, a message,a good feeling... <br>
<br>
It means that at the end of the day I do a lot of listening. I listen and try to understand what the client/student really wants and needs. <br>
<br>
I believe in separating the "architect" from the "builder". When my architect-work is done, we select the right medium: print, moving image, web,etc. Over the years I created a network of the finest "builders" in the country:graphical designers, cameramen, developers, editors, actors, etc. <br>
<br>
Most of the time, an enormeous added value is liberated when open-minded specialists in their field are working together! <br>
<br>
I'm not an ad agency (some of them are my best customers ;). If you compare an ad agency to a supermarket, my company is a small delicatessen store.<br>
<br>
So you see, the "candy store remark" wasn't too far from reality, but hey, I don't know about you, but I spent some of the best times of my life in candy stores, as a matter of fact I was BORN in the food store of my parents...<br>
<br>
For the past 6 years I've been running my own shop working with a network of the finest freelancers and agencies in Belgium. I'm 47 but I'm still going strong and I'm full of new ideas !<br>
<br>
I speak 5 languages quite fluently: Dutch (mothertongue), French, German, English and Spanish. Professionally I write in Dutch and English.<br>
<br>
MBTI personality type: ESTP (look it up!)

    <p class="description">I work freelance as a copywriter, screenwriter, director,information architect, usability expert and teacher. I also give no-nonsense communication advice to companies. Sometimes I work directly for a company or an organisation, but mostly I work as a subcontractor for advertising agencies, video production companies, web agencies, etc. I worked for a lot of big names but unfortunately I'm not allowed to mention them ;) A few highlights: <br>
<br>
- dialogue writer for the famous soap series "Thuis" on VRT for 2 years<br>
- finalist in the Copywriting course/Talent hunt of the CCB (4th on a total of 280)<br>
- I wrote, directed and produced a series of 30 episodes for the Flemish regional tv stations on building and construction (Bouw en woon advies)<br>
- I got bitten so hard by the subject that I did a post graduate "Usability Design" at the university of Leuven at the blessed age of 44 ;)<br>
- I have been teaching scriptwriting since 2002 and analysis for websites since 2005</p>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">This company runs medieval dinner shows (fighting knights, jester, firespitters, etc) in a former church in the center of Bruges. Average of two shows a week, with +- 200 people per show. As general manager I was responsible for an industrial kitchen (feeding up to 500 people at once), the show (now I know how a circus director feels;) and the marketing and sales, mainly to Belgian companies and tourists from all over the world (directly or via touroperators). <br>
<br>
Belgium is a country where theme dinners are relatively unknown by the public. In Holland, for example, several major companies exploit a range of different sites and themes, sometimes catering for 1500 people at once in the appropriate setting. Themes go from pirates, Romans, the roaring 20's, medieval to Arabian nights, etc, etc...<br>
<br>
It's the most satisfying job you can think of. Imagine 500 people giving you and your co-workers a standing ovation (in a church!) at the end of every show...unforgettable!</p>

    <p class="description">I got a chain of 40 neglected travel agencies and their staff to start with (Transcontinental voyages with some leftover Havas and other agencies). After changing the name to Belgium International Travel  I rebuilt/redecorated around 20 agencies in 2 years, not counting 10 new agencies we opened. In the mean time, we took over another 20 agencies (Ultra Montes) and integrated them. We trained all the staff (140 people), installed new phones, new computer systems, a central commercial and communication structure and raised the turnover in 2 years time with about 25 %. Later, the name was changed into TUI travel centers  and finally into Jetair travel centers.</p>

    <p class="description">My entrance in the service industry. We exploited a whole range of regular coach lines through Europe, which meant a lot of meetings with other European coach companies. As a young guy of 26-27 I had to translate (sometimes agitated conversations) from Spanish to German and other strange combinations. Needless to say I learned a lot there. I made up a whole new organisation scheme, appointed new lower level managers and their responsibilities and started the marketing department from scratch (new housestyle, timetables, etc) I learned a lot from working with Jean Wyns, the "Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgian tourism", now the big boss of all Eurolines in Paris.</p>
