              <p class="interests">Overall technology enthusiast, Web 2.0 technologies, Ubuntu, website development, graphic arts. 

I enjoy vacations where I can go diving, physical fitness, biking, boxing, NFL football, fantasy football, and spending time with my family.

I also might be the only person in the world that enjoys building quad-boot servers (Solaris, Ubuntu, Vista, XP) on weekends just to see if I can do it. :)</p>
