              <p class="summary">
                Technical Writer/Trainer/Developer, with diverse skills honed in a Database Consulting background in niche industries for a decade. Abbas has gained his Business Transformation edge through years of tactical experience in Information Management and Business Process Engineering. Information Management Consulting on Document Management Systems and Workflow Management Systems like SpyderWeb (by BTG at the GOMO, Pentagon,) and NovaManage (worldwide) through the mid 90's enabled Abbas to gain an advanced perspective of the field years before Documentum and Hummingbird defined an entire genre. Strategic vision is his specialty, as well as his passion. Abbas likes to examine an industry from a variety of perspectives, and using proven communications skills, builds bridges where none exist while gaining precious insight few can claim. This has proven to be the case time and again, and is the reason why Abbas finds great friendships with previous colleagues, even where he may not have maintained contact for years.

Demonstrated personal budgeting applications of algebra, figuring out distances via geometry, the importance and relevance of calculus in our world, and how physics is exciting beyond words! My classes were abuzz with excitement, and my students saw how Math applied to life. I engaged my students with fun examples like measuring distances to buildings with just a string, a compass and a common ruler. To interest my 12th grade class in Physics, I developed a safe and structured fencing game which I called &quot;Momentum Dynamics&quot;. My 10th grade class was doing Chemistry, balancing chemical equations, as a live example of Algebra. I was the Student's favorite teacher, because I listened to them.</p>

    <p class="description">Globe trotting work utilized a refined consulting methodology which I implemented on NovaManage, a predecessor to Documentum and Hummingbird, far ahead of its time. This folder-style EDMS presented a built-in, rules-based Workflow Management System which enabled me to reduce the paper consumption of my clients while streamlining their business processes. BPR is a natural consequence of translating existing business workflows to an electronic format. Client relationships and expectation management is where the real skill came in, and why I was always used as a front-line consultant, expanding the market for others to follow and grow.<br>
<br>
NovaManage ran on an Oracle back-end, so I was doing my own Oracle systems administration, installing and configuring major UNIX OS's while tweaking Oracle instances, and integrating disparate systems to work together.  Clients included Thai Oil (Thailand), GE PPSD (NY), SmithKline Beecham (PR), Genentech (CA), and Applied Komatsu Technologies (CA).</p>

Saved the VenDoc department (Vendor Documentation) from onerous contractual obligations by implementing a change-management workflow and folder-based Electronic Document format which enabled quick access to easy search of incomplete parts. This enabled GE to go back to Hitachi (Japan) and re-negotiate strict contractual clauses because Hitachi's own shortcomings became apparent through our newly developed (transparent) procedure.

    <p class="description">UI Architect on WMATA's ground-breaking implementation of ParaTransit, w/ BDM as prime. Used XDB Pro, the powerful XDB 4-GL, to construct a foolproof character-based user-interface which managed memory within 640K.  This was later increased 1MB, with live memory management, and hot menu-access updates based on a user's modifiable role-designation. This character-based system was fast, responsive and conflict independent despite parallel transaction processing before the term even existed. Project Manager, Kelly O&#x2019;Neil, empowered us to take risks, which paid off when a re-architecture of the UI resulted in additional capabilities not even considered before.  I received glowing recommendations after the 13 month project was over, from my my PM &amp; SEMA managers (Kay Mahan &amp; Tony Starks), leading to the coveted &quot;Sustained Superior Performance Award for 1994&quot;.
