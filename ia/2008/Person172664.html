            <h2>Seneca &quot;The Beast&quot; Doss&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                My background in music is extensive but rather short. My first internship was at HOT97 working under the Director of Music Advertising in 2001. Later on during the internship, I was put on payroll and was doing street team for CD101.9, KissFM and HOT97. I later left to become a personal assistant for Darrin Henson of Soul Food. It was with Darrin that I broke out and initially learned that my fate would soon lead to publicity because even though I was coined the assistant, the things I did where publicity driven. I got interviews on him with Lenny Green of KissFM, WPGC in DC and XM radio to promote his calendar. I also arranged his appearance at the Hue-Man Bookstore in Harlem for his calendar signing.<br>
<br>
Eventually Darrin and I would go separate ways. I would do other internships and ventures to increase my strengths as a good worker at such places like Excite Media as a product placement intern and The Brooklyn Academy of Music just to name a few. In 2006 I worked for a Brooklyn based Music PR boutique as a music publicist with alternative acts like Dashboard Confessional and MC Lars. In my artist folder... I secured interviews, previews and etc. for alternative bands like: Nightmare Of You, DJ Hyper, Digweed and The Lordz.<br>
<br>
Since going independent, I've gotten many of my own clients in such publications and online sites like Allhiphop.com, Black Beat Magazine, Rolling Out Weekly, Hip-Hop Connection, Allaboutjazz.com and many others.<br>
<br>
*Most recently "The Cipha Sounds Effect/Shade 45 with Sirius Radio" (Dec. 04 2007)<br>
<br>
On The Side:<br>
<br>
*I'm also a writer for urban takeover sites, Hiphopruckus.com and AmalgamDigital.com.<br>
<br>
*Entertainment site Starpulse.com<br>
<br>
*Contributing writer for Brooklyn publication Courier-Life.
