<br>
Our first clinic has started in a densely populated, low-income district known as "Green Town", lying adjacent to an industrial zone in Lahore, Pakistan. <br>
<br>
Rather than growing the clinic into a large, multi-specialty facility at one location, we aim open clinics in other locations of similar profile, in far flung areas, adding specialists to our team, and incorporating telemedicine so that we can bring highly qualified specialists to the doorsteps of people who can not afford them.<br>
<br>
We are seeking collaboration, advice, and support in the telemedicine field.</p>
