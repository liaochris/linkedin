            <h2>Scott Place (mavericknc@gmail.com)&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am a seasoned sales and marketing professional with significant achievements in both disciplines. My experience includes primarily entrepreneurial high growth companies, but also includes large Fortune 500 experience as well.  This means I have seen brilliant successes as well as spectacular failures. I can bring know how in what to do to succeed and what to avoid.<br>
<br>
My career is in transition from consultant to writer. I still do consulting on marketing and public relations, but my work will, hopefully, be more centered on writing and editing projects in areas that I am passionate about.<br>
<br>
When I'm not working, I am either having fun with my very signficant other and 3 soon to be 5 kids. I might also be trying to recapture my youth by pretending to be Lance Armstrong on my Trek bike.
