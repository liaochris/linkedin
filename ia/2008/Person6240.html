            <h2>Alexander Kidonakis&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Currently running a management consulting firm specializing in media consulting in its wider sense. Media are viewed as channels of communication extending from a simple telephone call, a post it note, a letter, a  meeting, an interview, a political debate, a news article, a communication and/or advertising message in mass media. <br>
<br>
Our job is to determine the communication and media strategy, orchestrate the relevant media and manage the message delivery process to optimise its costs in a given time frame to approach a prespecified objective. (Be it a commercial, political, non-profit, environmental etc).<br>
<br>
My practice is based on the Systemic Appreciative approach. <br>
<br>
Systemic: We focus on HOW things work. We research that from many different perspectives. We aim to understand the whole system. <br>
<br>
Appreciative: We research each issue by focusing on what really WORKS.<br>
We focus on the solution not the problem. We want to create allies not guilty people. Our key aim is  to allign all needed resources to attain the objective. <br>
<br>
We focus on DELIVERY of the agreed. When we do we want a share in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Research Consulting for the effective use of the Media. Primary focus on perception research including proprietary techniques applied in diverse markets. <br>
<br>
Examples: <br>
<br>
Problem Perceived Hierarchy Research (PPH) in  diverse  fields (eg. Commercial, Health Care Industry, Education, Politics, Environmental Protection, etc)<br>
<br>
Emotional Response Evaluation and Engagement (EREE) Research. Proprietary Research Tools to measure emotional response to communication.<br>
<br>
Visulal Perception Research. Proprietary Research Tools to analyze perception in visual communication. Focus on non verbal communication. Applications in Advertising, Politics, Local Authorities, etc.

      <p class="notes">What I learned there. All problems are about the optimal allocation of resources be it money, goods, water or fresh air. It matters what you are trying to optimize. You cannot model everything, reality is far more complex than you can understand centrally. Global optimization however is feasible once you allow thousands if not millions of local optimizations. Beyond techniques that can serve any objective it is the main objective you are trying  to optimize that is far more important than the solution itself.<br>

      <p class="notes">What I learned there. Discipline of thought. Step by step inference. Building a totaly logical system, even though you have to base the whole structure on axioms. However  at least one axiom will remain unproved. (Goedel's Theorem). Another set of axioms will lead to an equally robust system. Euclidean Geometry can be equally robust with non Euclidean Geometries.<br>
<br>
Physics taught me that we cannot know all. Shroedinger's equation says that. The better you measure one thing the more ignorant you become for another. Furthermore Quantum Mechanics indicates that measurement itself is an act of interference. You will measure what you are seeking to measure, and you may not never see what you don't seek to see.<br>
<br>
Albert Einstein taught me that no problem can be solved following the same line of thought that created it. You have to try a new approach to tackle it.  Werner Heisenberg taugh me to be humble and a free spirit.</p>

Beyond being a tough school, housed in a lousy building, they taught us Ethos, both in class and by example. I am eternaly gratefull for my school years, both for my teachers and the lifetime frienships i made there.<br>
The age of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Mexico World Cup, Pele, the Italian Songs, the romantic French, the time when skirts went up by Mary Quant, the troubled political time in Greece.</p>
