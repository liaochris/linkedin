            <h2>John J. Wonders&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                First and foremost I am a Renaissance Man.  My interests are far too broad for me to mention them all here, there just isn’t the space.  You can get a bit of an idea what I’m talking about by looking at my current positions.<br>
<br>
On a personal level:<br>
My latest endeavor is that I am now a Clydesdale in training.  What that really means is that I’m a big guy who is attempting to compete in a triathlon.  I will try to complete my first in the summer of 08 and we’ll see where things go from there.  If you really want to know more about it you can check out my blog at http://JustKeepGoing.net/blog<br>
<br>
On a professional level:<br>
I’m an IT guy and I recently landed with the exact kind of company and position that I have been looking for here in the Milwaukee area.  I’m still working on the R&D for everything, but as soon as I can I will provide more detail.<br>
<br>
On both levels:<br>
I am an avid networker within the Milwaukee area.  The local Milwaukee group that I started continues to grow at an impressive rate.  The turnout at our Link Up is now in the 70’s each month.  I’m always looking to meet new people in the Milwaukee area and willing to lend a networking hand whenever I can.
