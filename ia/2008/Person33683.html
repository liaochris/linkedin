    <p class="description">Over the past eight years, I've been using the web to market products and services to consumers. In addition to my work hosting + producing Well-Rounded Radio and marketing it to users around the world, I've developed a deep well of knowledge about web marketing, including viral video, audio + video podcasts, adwords, SEM/SEO, analytics, e-mail marketing, re-designs + re-launches, blogs, social networking, banner advertising, e-commerce, wikis, microblogging, mobile promotions, and...whatever's next...to engage consumers with brands.<br>
<br>
Even though we are still in the early days of this kind of interactivity, we've already seen how these technologies can engage current customers--and attract new ones--with a new level of "honest" marketing and community-building along with fostering relationships with your customers that goes well beyond just marketing "to" them.<br>
