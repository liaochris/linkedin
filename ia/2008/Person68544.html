              <p class="summary">
                Strategist and Visionary, who enjoys building dynamic companies from the ground up. Have managed small medium and larger companies with offices in multiple countries. Traded internationally on almost all continents. (not Antarctica!) Politically astute and well read. <br>
Managing people from all walks of life and enabling them to grow with a corporation is one of my best talents. I have done this in the UK, Canada and the USA over the past 25 years. I have utilized latest technologies as they became available to increase efficiency and bottom line results. <br>
However I do not rely exclusively on technology as people are any company's most valued asset. I work with people to help them maximize their potential.

    <p class="description">I was elected to the Board of the SFF by an almost unanimous decision of the rank and file members. My duties involved fundraising and outreach. It was through this position that I transformed my music book publishing company into a space book company that contracts with NASA, Boeing, Lockheed and many other aerospace entities. While I was a board member at SFF, several members of the general body leased and operated the MIR space station from the Russian Government. I worked closely and diligently to support their efforts in this regard. Whilst in this position I also sat on a Senate Roundtable panel to inform the US Government about space issues. I was also called to join a very high ranking group to advise the government in the aftermath of the Columbia disaster.</p>

Third party sellers were integrated within the main website and were utilized for distributing CD's from all major CD producing nations to almost any single person on the planet. The business model was very efficient and successful. We were able to undercut Amazon.com on import CD prices by 40% and still make a healthy 40% margin by utilizing our unique business model.<br>
Unfortunately the company was folded after our source of capital dried up due to circumstances beyond our control and because of no fault of our company.</p>

    <p class="description">Brit-Am was formed when my business partner and I purchased a small division of Thorn EMI from that company. When we purchased the company it was supplying food service equipment to many large corporations throughout the UK.

We built industrial foodservice facilities for such corporations as Marriott Hotels, Harrods, Woolworth's Plc, Grand Metropolitan Plc, Trust House Forte, Shell Oil, BP Oil, The Ministry of Defence and many others.<br>

    <p class="description">The Springbank Hotel is a stone gothic manor house in the north of England. 24 bedrooms, 4 bars, 2 restaurants, nightclub etc. I bought it when it was bankrupt and was about to close its doors. In six months I had renovated most of the bedrooms, the restaurants and bars and main function room. By Christmas of 1981  we were almost full to capacity in all areas of the hotel. We catered for upmarket clientele including CEO of Rolls Royce and other local large corporations, TV and movie persona and ultimately Mrs Thatcher visited us. As one of 2 owners I oversaw all operations regarding running of the hotel, banqueting, restaurant, bars, etc. I sold the hotel exactly one year after purchase for a substantial profit and went into Hotel/restaurant design.</p>

  </p>
  
    <p class="description">I started the first Amigos restaurant in downtown Manchester England as an experiment. It was a fast food restaurant which was very new for the day back then in the UK. It was a hybrid mixture of a McDonald's and a Taco Bell. After proof of concept I was able to raise the funds to open a much larger location in January of 1980. We literally had lines of customers around the building from day one. I designed the operation, created the menu and recipes, hired and trained the staff and ran the operation on a daily basis. We received many accolades and were reported in the national press. Many other fast food start ups in the UK came to observe us and I was employed several times as a consultant to other companies at the time.<br>
I sold the company for a substantial profit just after I had bought the Springbank Hotel.</p>
