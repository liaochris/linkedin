High energy, restless techie having respect for business goals. Working in four startups, apart from the engineering skills, I have been exposed to a lot of very important areas viz. extensive interaction with customer support, sales, marketing, product management and qa teams.

<br>

<br>
I enjoy leading really smart and brilliant minds and working very closely with them. At the same time I create and groom new engineering and thought leaders in the organization. <br>
<br>
I am a strong believer of the India growth story and thats why I returned from California in 2005 to start and lead the Engineering team of Riya in Bangalore. Before that I provided strong engineering leadership in Andale and helped them grow in their Bangalore center.

    <p class="description">Riya Visual Search has pioneered the advent of ubiquitous availability of years of visual computing research to the general public. I am the founder of Riya's Engineering team in India. We worked on a highly disruptive visual search concept, that changed the way the world does shopping online. Check out the breath-taking www.like.com, which has the "Likeness search" technology not to be found anywhere else. Our pioneering product for visual computing on web-scale consumer photos is  www.riya.com - it is an state-of-the-art Face and Text recognition application. I played a key role in setting up the India Engineering team and was also responsible for delivery of the two products in a big way. Worked with the US team of 14 Stanford Computer Vision PhDs, and 6 Engineering and Management members from Cornell and Stanford - led and grew the team at Bangalore from a one-man-army to 30 engineers and 4 researchers.<br>
<br>
Funds were from Nokia Venture Partners, Bay Partners and Leapfrog Ventures.</p>
