    <p class="description">ChronWatch.com is a counter force to the liberal advocacy so dominant in today's media.  ChronWatch provides articles from a group of in-house writers, in addition to carefully selected material from the Internet.  As a result, ChronWatch is your one-stop site for the conservative point of view.<br>
<br>
I've written for ChronWatch as a regular columnist on political matters of the day as well as just fun stuff.  Up until a major hack of the website in early 2007, I had over 180 articles in the archive (we're still trying to recover them).  However, the number is creeping back up again, slowly but surely.<br>
<br>
To quote my online bio, "Doc Farmer is a columnist, security consultant, humorist, and part-time curmudgeon living in America's heartland."</p>
