            <h2>David Weekly&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm young, but I've been around the block; I've been programming since I was five and have been online since 1990. I started working professionally with an internship at GenRad in 1993 helping build sniffer databases of Ethernet addresses (I ended up building their first website). I then moved on to simulations and visualizations of antimatter recombination at Harvard, pattern recognition evaluation systems at MIT, and mesh alignment optimization algorithms at Stanford. I've since helped dozens of companies put products together and refine their vision, created audio algorithms, wrote half a book on MP3s (after writing the first layman's description on my personal site that was eating 80% of Stanford's outbound bandwidth), taught technology to over 100 kids in Ghana, reported on CES and Comdex for the Korean media, and ran research surveys on GMOs in Sweden. I love working on problems of all sorts, technical or otherwise, and in all kinds of environments. I'm one of those wacky technologists that actually enjoys people. (I have been known to help put together huge parties.) I love working with an excellent group of people to create something out of nothing. I love founding companies and non-profits, and it's a habit I'm not likely to break any time soon. :)
