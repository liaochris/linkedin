            <h2>jeff jack&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                At the tender age of 13, more than 20 years ago - I began making video games. At that time, we adopted a "choose your own adventure" theme to create text based encounters. <br>
<br>
I have since created games for Disney Interactive, been a founding team member of several substantial web properties including CarsDirect.com and PartsAmerica - and have continued to help make digital media more and more accessible to the widest possible audience. <br>
<br>
Among my guiding principles are the understanding that Best Practices are benchmarks to be exceeded - that thinking 10 years down the line should be a STARTING POINT - that GREEN has always been in - that wasting money, whatever the source, is BAD for business - and that a small dedicated team that groks a project, will destroy much larger teams who don't. <br>
<br>
I like to work with folks who are the best in the world... It is my great good fortune that I always seem to.<br>
<br>
At 35 years old (in March 07) I am a seasoned senior executive with a stellar history. My current situation (SPROKKIT) allows me to enjoy a great deal of variety of client interaction, project development and creative freedom. As one of the premier franchise advertising, branding, marketing, and technology service companies in the industry we have enjoyed steady and significant growth, even in the short time that I have been here. We're in the middle of our own re-branding effort. Check out our website (http://www.sprokkit.com) and let me know what you think. <br>
<br>
One thing that gives me the most confidence when interacting with prospective business partners, or clients is when there is laughter between us. I won't stand for stodgy or curmudgeoned thinking. I will admit that it may be the entertainer in me - but I love being with a group of jokers - who get serious business done.

    <p class="description">As EVP/Partner for Sprokkit - a boutique agency specializing in web 2.0, flash, web media, television commercial, print, and custom solutions for clients - my job is to bring more business, make our existing business better, and add value to our clients by helping them creatively kick some competitive arse. <br>
<br>
We're an advertising/branding/marketing/technology company for franchise operators. Our forte is truly in creating unique, customized messaging for these franchise sales groups.<br>
<br>
A rock solid operation - with world class talent and line dancing? Yes - except the line dancing part. We are fortunate to have an incredible roster of clients - with continual growth. (Nearly doubling each year for the last 2 years.)<br>
<br>
QSR's are widely supported as are hotels, restaurants, mortgage industry folks, and more.<br>
<br>
The versatility of the company is well suited to my varied interests and tastes.</p>

    <p class="description">This was a drummers seat. 6 others held the position, in 5 years.<br>
<br>
I was brought into manage a sitting team of talent that had been together between 4-8 years. As their manager I was to provide them with "something" to do throughout the day. <br>
<br>
My task throughout my tenure was to 1) defend the team as a unit - and secure ongoing support from DMI's lead investor as to the future of the team. 2) Define and create new product lines that could be sold independent of any sales team. The first product launched was QuikDisk (http://www.quikdisk.com), 7 more were slated for development and release.<br>
<br>
Throughout - I was instrumental in providing sure footed guidance in strategy, development and business development support to Private Label Radio, 5Alarm Music, and Firehouse Records - all are properties of DMI.<br>
<br>
UPDATE : Following my leaving DMI - my team formed the concern : "BigRigInteractive.com" as a shingle. (GO TEAM!) Lead by Roderick Peace, programmer extraordinare.</p>

    <p class="description">FirstLook was the furthering of MusicNow/Woodstock.com.<br>
<br>
My estimation was that my investment in CarsDirect (blood, sweat, tears, blood) was going to pay off... however, my earlier investment of same assets in MusicNow, then FirstLook.com - was in jeopardy. With an elusive business model, and a disjointed management team - I returned to FL to do whatever I was able. My first project upon returning was to define and create an affiliate/membership tool set that would give us SOMETHING to call our own in an impossibly competitive marketplace. Additionally, I offered my experience in large scale asset management to help map our content paths. We had an ambitious effort before us with the cataloging and content production of over 3 million titles.<br>
<br>
FirstLook was tumultuous from the start - however - several folks became and remain close and trusted friends and advisers.</p>

    <p class="description">As the 9th employee, my charge was to make the company happen. I assembled several teams, established several departments including our online marketing and brand development teams. I was in the unique position of being the glue for the company through the early struggles and growth spurts. I, along with the EVP of Operations, scripted every aspect and touch point of our client interaction. So "handled" was our system that it became the foundation and framework that Internet Brands operates with today. In addition, as I also lead our online marketing efforts, and established an internal agency, my founding principles have also demonstrated themselves to be solid. I spent no money foolishly - despite having a $100 million budget. Not a fan of "shotgun" spending - I preferred to target my spends. (This was unheard of at the time, but has now since become an industry standard.)<br>
<br>
I left CarsDirect shortly after our purchase of GreenLight.com - when our staff had grown to 750 people.</p>

    <p class="description">I joined DI as a production supervisor, which everywhere else would have been called a technical producer. My role was to sheppard my products through their entire lifecycle from ideation to delivery - and play an instrumental role in working with all external companies for animation, audio, programming and more.<br>
<br>
My role with Disney was interesting. I loved my team, my job, and the place. While I was there I created a production management tool called "DREEMS" (Disney's Really Efficient Everything Management System) - that I'd originally used to control all assets of 101 Dalmatians ASB. For me, it worked like a friggin' dream. My pet project was given a budget - and became a standard for the edutainment division. Although, once it left my hands - I started creating another tool.</p>
