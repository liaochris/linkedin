            <h2>Graham Cobb&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Early in the year I undertook some Financial Services BI consultantancy contract work with COGNOS providing support to all UK and European Account and Service Management Teams in driving revenue generation, and have now taken a full time role with the Company<br>
<br>
I was formerly Head of UK Banking Management Information Development and Infrastructure for Barclays. Responsible for delivering Performance Management Information solutions to some 48,000 end users across all UK Bank Distribution Channels, whilst developing and ensuring a quality and forward planned infrastructure was in place to support that delivery.<br>
<br>
I had leadership and development responsibility for five permanent and outsourced development teams and 1 infrastructure team totalling over 38 staff, located over multiple sites including London, Coventry, Knutsford and Chennai India. I have previously been responsible for much larger teams operating across a range of resource models. In addition I had management responsibility for £5m staff budgets and £3-5m annual investment spend, whilst also being the Barclays relationship manager with key software and consultancy suppliers such as COGNOS/Business Objects, and Tata consultancy Services.<br>
<br>
I am a Prince 2 Professionally qualified project manager with extensive BI Programme and Project Management experience, along with some 18 years of Team Leadership experience mostly working at a senior and executive level. I also have particular experience in establishing and developing new teams, development of their capabilities and motivating those teams to deliver to very demanding timescales. This has included the leading of organisational design and change management initiatives involving process re-engineering to deliver cost effective teams delivering efficient processes and end customer solutions.
