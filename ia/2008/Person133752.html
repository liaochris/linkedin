            <h2>Mitchell Tsai&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm currently retired, but enjoy supporting new ventures and helping people manifest their visions and dreams.<br>
<br>
CEO and Founder of Spiritual Business Companions, a network supporting "sustainable abundance", "healthy employee growth", and other ethical business practices, emphasis on US micro-businesses.<br>
<br>
Since 1990, I have advised entrepreneurs and companies in 98 industries - managing small teams of 1-10 and medium teams of 400-600 people.<br>
<br>
I enjoy helping people bootstrap ideas and early-stage companies (US Micro-businesses; e.g. starting a company with US $50 - $500), helping them develop into successful "lifestyle companies" (US $200,000 - $5 million), and navigating dangers and finding opportunities as they become growth and/or venture-capital-backed companies (US $10 million - $1+ billion).  <br>
<br>
Co-Founder of DotCom Director, a business incubator that provided venture funding, strategy, and technology - Clients included Legal Research Network (LRN.com) which was funded by Softbank for $30 million, and medi.com (medical claims) which was acquired by WebMD for $280 million and was one of Deloitte & Touche's "Technology Fast 50".  <br>
 <br>
Consulting since 1980 in the business, military, government, academic, and non-profit sectors.  Designed, produced, and/or implemented projects for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Science Foundation (NSF), DARPA, Department of Defense (DoD), Harvard University, Fortune 500s, Global 2000s, NGOs, colleges and universities, and medical schools.  <br>
<br>
Projects range from small US $0-$100 micro-business and non-profit bootstrap projects to multi-billion dollar projects such as distribution ($14 billion), communication ($32 billion), finance ($50 billion), and logistics ($302 billion).  <br>
<br>
My first consulting project at age 13 was a financial analysis program to assist my high school teachers in salary negotiations as they compared various salary/benefit packages.

    <p class="description">Helping People's Visions Manifest into Reality with the 5 C's - Community, Connections, Coaching, Consulting, Capital<br>
<br>
CEO and Founder of Spiritual Business Companions, a network supporting "sustainable abundance", "healthy employee growth", and other ethical business practices, emphasis on US micro-businesses (starting companies with US $50-500+).<br>
<br>
"Sustainable abundance" - There's plenty of support for our projects and visions if we use our capital, labor, emotional, health, and spiritual resources in effective sustainable ways.<br>
<br>
Burning people out through poor management is no better than wasting our environment. :-)<br>
<br>
The beginning of a network of companies and private funds to create an "educational network to support entrepreneurs".<br>
<br>
I believe there's a huge gap in "entrepreneurial support" sub-$20-50 million companies, where "lifestyle companies" have great potential.  A single-person "lifestyle company" can produce $1-10 million gross revenue.</p>

Dance provides us with the opportunity to enrich ourselves and the greater community.<br>
<br>
We are committed to the acceptance of and respect for all people and cultures, the empowerment of children, and the acknowledgement that our bodies and our environment are sacred. <br>

Each of us needs to safely express who we are and be acknowledged for the value of our contributions to our community. <br>
<br>
These include a cooperative spirit, interdependence, and sustainable volunteerism.<br>

Consensus decision-making, non-violent conflict resolution, collective work, personal responsibility, educational inreach and outreach, and flexibility in the face of the need to change are tenets of our organizational democracy.<br>

    <p class="description">Since 1990, I have advised entrepreneurs and companies in 98 industries - managing small teams of 1-10 and medium teams of 400-600 people.<br>
 <br>
Consulting since 1980 in business, military, government, academic, and non-profit sectors.  <br>
<br>
Designed, produced, and/or implemented projects for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Science Foundation (NSF), DARPA, Department of Defense (DoD), Harvard University, Fortune 500s, Global 2000s, NGOs, colleges and universities, and medical schools.  <br>
<br>
Projects range from small US $0-$100 micro-business and non-profit bootstrap projects to multi-billion dollar projects such as distribution ($14 billion), communication ($32 billion), finance ($50 billion), and logistics ($302 billion).  <br>
<br>
My first consulting project at age 13 was a financial analysis program to assist my high school teachers in salary negotiations as they evaluated the overall value of various salary/benefit packages.</p>

    <p class="description">It’s sad to see how poorly project management has<br>
progressed in the past 30 years.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of projects are still over-budget, inadequately planned, and poorly executed.  Moreover due to poor management and oversight, the people working in the projects are often overworked and badly treated.<br>
<br>
A fan of “fail fast” strategies, I hate all the wasted effort and "wealth destruction" in early companies because our US business processes & US educational system provide so little quality support to empower entrepreneurs.</p>
