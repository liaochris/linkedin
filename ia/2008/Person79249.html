            <h2>Idrise Abdi&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm an experienced software engineer and am currently specializing in the Microsoft .NET platform.  Most of my experience in Houston has been in the energy sector although, as a consultant, I've been involved in numerous industries.<br>
<br>
I've the past several years, I've been focusing on key, senior-level consulting positions.  The more recent projects have utilized custom SharePoint / MOSS applications.  They included heavy integration of BPM (Business Process Management), SharePoint and ECM (Electronic Content Managment).  I've completed three major BPM-related solutions for Schlumberger.<br>
<br>
I'm a strong proponent of code generation.  It can be applicable to most projects in some capacity, and when used wisely, will substantially decrease development and maintenance time.<br>
<br>
One area that I'd really like to explore professionally are RIAs (Rich Internet Applications).  I remember being fascinated with RIAs five years ago but the tool-sets were primitive and development was really time consuming.  I'm excited to see this area finally having some potential to enter into mainstream development as a useful tool with the advent of Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and related technologies.<br>
<br>
Another exciting area is BPM/Workflow.  After having used K2.NET Workflow for a couple years now, its been exciting to see the developments of Microsoft's Windows Workflow (part of the 3.0 .NET framework).

    <p class="description">I developed extensive SharePoint implementations.  This work involved architecting and developing ASP.NET Server Controls, User Controls and custom Web Parts developed in C#.  These custom web parts ranged from ordinary to the more complicated types (connected web parts, custom tool parts). <br>
<br>
Most of these solutions integrated with a workflow engine.  The primary engine used was K2.NET.  I developed advanced workflows and custom integration components utilizing .NET and the K2.NET API.  I consider myself an advanced K2.NET Workflow solutions developer.</p>

    <p class="description">At the time of this project, Spark Energy was in a rapid growth phase.  The primary focus in this phase was to enter new deregulated markets.  Most markets utilize EDI for their transactions such as enrollments, drops, historical usage, billing, etc.  The goal of this project was to make a framework from which new markets could be entered into rapidly.  Another goal was to implement a new-market template to further expedite entering into new markets.<br>
<br>
Some accomplishments in achieving these goals were:<br>
<br>
•	Became fluent with underlying business processes and work-flow for dozens of EDI transactions.<br>
•	Created an EDI-XML mapping engine generic enough to handle dissimilar EDI transaction implementations.<br>
•	Implemented measures to increase scalability.<br>
•	SQL tuning<br>
•	Proposed system improvements<br>
•	Worked productively without close supervision<br>
<br>
In addition to these achievements, I also lead and mentored several junior developers.</p>

    <p class="description">United Stationers is North America’s largest wholesale distributor of business products. The Supplier Compliance application was designed to track and manage shipping violations to United Stationers warehouses.  The system facilitates the entire business workflow from the employees at the receiving docks who enter violations to A.R. where the payment of fines are tracked and recorded.<br>
<br>
Web services were used to encapsulate business logic and expose generic and U.I. independent functions.  The UI allows recording of shipping violations to a shipment manifest.  The supplier compliance system includes a supplier dispute component to manage disputes on violation entries and integrates with accounts receivable to impose fines on supplier shipping violations.<br>
<br>
My primary role was to guide and assist United Stationers’ employees on the team who had little .NET experience.  This role includes ensuring best practices are being used and writing code and documentation for overrunning tasks.</p>

Prior to this completion of this project, a third party processed all credit card authorizations.  FTD had brokered an agreement with American Express to make direct credit card authorizations and automatic address verification to the American Express credit card authorization systems.<br>
<br>
I created the functional and technical documentation for this system.  I utilized resources from American Express on implementation planning, ISO 8583 message formats and data and certification testing.  I modified the existing system, which takes credit card authorization requests from FTD’s call center and web sites, to route American Express authorization requests directly to American Express.  I created a class representing an ISO 8583 message, a standard for communication between financial systems, and made necessary changes into the existing system.</p>

Email was used as the transport mechanism to aggregate the data from clients running the application.  I oversaw a four-person team to replace the previous system with a web–based application implemented in .NET in order to alleviate many of the shortcomings of the previous system. Another BA and I worked with stakeholders, domain experts and users to gather functional specifications.  I authored and maintained and functional specification documentation, and participated in meetings with stakeholders to refine requirements.<br>
<br>
I designed and documented the architecture whose constituents included service oriented architecture, business façade pattern, abstract factory pattern, User Interface Process Blocks 2.0 and Exception Management blocks.  I created UML diagrams, when useful, which helped communicate with developers stakeholders.</p>

Creating and working with a large database presented many performance challenges that extended beyond the scope of a table definition or stored procedure.  In addition to the .NET development, I was a strong contributor to the database components of the project.  Individually, I developed a couple accessory tools; one used low level socket programming and a Windows Service to move files across a firewall.<br>
This client now has a much more efficient marketing machine.  My client has a competitive edge not only from the wealth of data they possess; but because they are able to intelligently extract strategic information from that data.</p>

    <p class="description">This system facilitates mass recruiting campaigns by employing electronic candidate screenings, electronic interview scheduling, tracking and reporting.<br>
<br>
Cornerstone Senior needed to automate their recruiting system so that it could accommodate large volumes of candidates.  The recruiting system logs which advertising source candidates originated from and pre-qualifies candidates through a survey.  Cornerstone hired a team of part-time interviewers who would conduct phone interviews with pre-qualified candidates.  Their schedules are stored and maintained by the system.  Upon passing the pre-qualification survey, the candidate would automatically be assigned to an interview slot, driven off the interviewers’ schedules.  I created reports to show statistics on the recruiting workflow so that trends could be noticed and processes adjusted.<br>

    <p class="description">The X-change system is a large, mission critical system used to track national relocation referrals.  The system captures events of real estate transactions and apportions referral charges to X-change member accounts. I was able to quickly grasp the business and technical aspects of this system in order to successfully implement complex reporting and front end development.  A clever architecture was used which allowed declarative-type programming.  I also played a leading role in coordinating automated testing and load testing.</p>

    <p class="description">I worked as a developer for a prominent special education cooperative on a project to convert a manual process for entering, managing and tracking student and staff related information to a web-based application utilizing .NET.  My role included architecture design, development, testing and maintenance of several large pieces of functionality for the application.  Some components I worked on exclusively were the security framework and the caching framework.  The accomplishment I’m most proud of was a set of custom controls which included a complex data-grid and a search/filter control.  These controls proved to be so useful in expediting development that some pages were completely implemented in a matter of hours compared to days.</p>

    <p class="description">For the US Department of Education, I worked on the Safe Schools project at the University Of Illinois, School of Public Health.  The primary purpose of this project was to provide a way to collect and store caseworkers’ daily logs and integrate the data into a statistical analysis program.  A secondary requirement was to provide functionality for generating reports on this data that could be used by management.  <br>
<br>
I worked on this project through the full development lifecycle, initially meeting with key users to gather requirements, then architecting and developing the application.  As a result, the client has realized a dramatic increase in productivity, efficiency, and accuracy of its processes and systems.</p>

    <p class="description">For an Oregon-based grocery store chain, I served as the Lead Developer on a project to implement an e-commerce portal.  The first department to be brought online was the deli department.  This grocery store chain had a large deli department and seating area that was extremely busy during lunch hours.  The goal was to implement an application that would allow users to order and pay for meals online and pick up their meal at a specific time.  <br>
<br>
The reliable, accurate, and prompt receipt of orders to the deli was identified as having both high priority and high risk.  The client also wanted this project to have little impact on its IT infrastructure.  To address these needs, I implemented a robust remote printing module that generated reliable, near-real-time, and accurate printouts of incoming orders.</p>
