            <h2>Sandy Voellinger&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Mid-Sr level systems administrator, whom is well versed in multiple flavors of linux/unix including, Solaris, HPUX, Linux and so on.  I am also very skilled with multiple web based applications including Apache, Tomcat, Weblogic, and other J2EE associated systems, the various protocols such as SOAP, SNAC, XML and so on associated with Service Oriented Architecture's. <br>
<br>
Along with all the previously mentioned, I am well rounded with both understand, implementing and supporting the network and host based infrastructure surrounding the OS and application layers.  I currently support over 1600 hosts with applications ranging from industry standard J2EE based systems to highly intensive c++ based proprietary code, installed on a vast array of hardware and OS's including the versions of Unix/Linux above as well as Windows 2000 and 2003 Server. <br>
<br>
Finally, beyond my technical skill set, I posses excellent customer service skill sets developed early on working as a server in a restaurant and then later providing phone support for both domestic and international customers.  More recently I have become more involved with project management and the full SDLC process.
