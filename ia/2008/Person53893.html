•	Technology Transactions<br>
•	Telecommunications Law <br>

•	Employment Law <br>
Our attorneys are experts in either Technology Transactions or Employment Law and all of our lawyers are veterans of either top law firms or companies.  <br>
<br>
For our technology clients, we are able to work closely with a company’s legal team, often on an “in-house” basis, which allows us to develop a deep relationship with the client. <br>
<br>
We specialize in all aspects of employment law including: executive compensation; sexual harassment; discrimination; wage and hour law; and trade secrets.  We have also developed a widely regarded niche practice throughout California for representing senior executives (such as founders and entrepreneurs, CEOs, CFOs and managing directors of financial services firms) in employment negotiations and the resolution of complex employment disputes.</p>
