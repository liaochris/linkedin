            <h2>Michael Kuhn&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                My current objective is to continue in my education by attaining the degree of Ph.D.  Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have been exposed to many different fields.  My goal is to utilize this broad skill set by working on a cross-disciplinary topic for my dissertation.  Specifically, I am interested in the use of MEMS technology to design sensors which can operate both inside and outside the body.  This includes not only the sensor design but also design of the circuitry and antenna structure needed for actual telemetry.  I am also interested in studying the biological effects of EM radiation.  I am currently working on a project to use UWB technology for indoor localization. There are many different facets to this problem, including microwave circuit design (utilizing MMIC), UWB antenna design, MEMS fabrication/integration, digital communication, design of overall localization system, UWB channel effects, software development, etc.  This project is very exciting to me because it integrates the somewhat disjoint fields in which I have exposure.
