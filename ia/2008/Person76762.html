            <h2>Hans Fischmann&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Strategic / Partnership Marketing &amp; Business Development Professional at the intersection of TV and Tech<br>
<br>
For over a decade my career has been based on my ability to  define, strategize and implement revenue and marketing opportunities in the new and emerging media space.  My particular focus for the last several years is in the advanced advertising realm and my unique experience allows me to often bring a different perspective on problems and work towards a better approach and solution.<br>
<br>
While with Apple Computer I helped build the QuickTime TV content network and the relationships that ultimately led to the creation of the iTunes music store.  I was primarily responsible for developing, negotiating and maintaining IP-based distribution, licensing and syndication agreements with major brands including Disney, Time/Warner, Primedia, Viacom and Universal with an emphasis on music and video.  These synergistic, structurally complex, relationships required 'out-of-the-box' thinking and the creation of completely new business models.<br>
<br>
Working for GTE I negotiated a deal with the NFL to produce the first ever interactive television Super Bowl.  While at LMNO Productions I developed and negotiated an agreement to license content to Microsoft for their ITV efforts.  At Buzzsaw Media we were using video as value-added content to prevent CD piracy and increase sales. Recently, with MTV, I produced several video extras for distribution on their broadband portal Overdrive.<br>
<br>
Having worked for several dynamic and innovative companies I learned that I love to work in challenging environments that require passion and creativity.  Working with smart people that are focused and driven to create commercially viable products that have a social impact makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.   If you have an opportunity that lives up to those adjectives please don't hesitate to contact me.
