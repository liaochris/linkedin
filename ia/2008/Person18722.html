    <p class="description">Investigated Wireless and Wired Home Networking opportunities for Nortel, and proposed a home network administering product (network based). The home networking market is growing with the breakthroughs in data throughput to the home and technologies for home entertainment, and my job was to investigate the following areas:<br>
&#x2022;	Universal Plug N&#x2019; Play architecture and how Nortel customers (namely ISP&#x2019;s but also content providers) can leverage this architecture for money making opportunities<br>
&#x2022;	Digital Living Network Association&#x2019;s model which builds on the uPnP model to expand and investigate the areas of delivery of entertainment content (music, movies, services, etc.,) to the home for a premium as well as protection of this &#x201c;intellectual property&#x201d; for the content provider.<br>
&#x2022;	How these opportunities might fit into the new wireless protocols being sold to the home such as 802.11{a,b,g,i,n} and 802.16 , and how these technologies fit in the home of the future.</p>

    <p class="description">One of the Senior designers in a group implementing an interface between the PSTN SS7 Signaling network to Aptis, Bay and Shiva modem pools (Remote Access Servers). Joined the project at it&#x2019;s inception, helped choose which SS7 signaling server package to use and wrote the signaling interface specification for communication between the Signaling Server and the RAS (using a subset of DSM-CC).  A steep learning curve was incurred on this project, as I had no &#x201c;telephony&#x201d; experience before this project, and am now the &#x201c;expert&#x201d; when it comes to SS7 signaling in the group. Skills honed in this project:<br>
&#x2022;	SS7 signaling comprehension Bellcore and ANSI variants<br>
&#x2022;	Signaling from the Server to the RAS (DSM-CC for now, with studies done on the possible implementations using either Diameter or Q.931).<br>
&#x2022;	Customer presentation skills (have done many as a technical resource to our sales team).<br>
&#x2022;	Group management, when manager is either on vacation or too busy to attend to the groups&#x2019; needs.</p>

    <p class="description">Title was integration prime for DEC Mediaplex software. This package played MPEG-2 movies or run interactive services on a group of Alpha 2100 servers. This package integrated with the Nortel Concorde ATM (backbone) Switch as well as the Nortel Service. Worked directly with DEC Level 2 (i.e. Video Pump) team as well as liaison with outside customer (New Brunswick Telephone) on how system  would  work &#x201c;end to end&#x201d;. Gained experience in the following areas:<br>
&#x2022;	ATM network management, configuration, signaling (UNI 3.2 and 4.0), and the AAL5 protocol.<br>
&#x2022;	MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video standards and how they work with the ATM standard.<br>
&#x2022;	System Integration, working directly with development groups to ensure the &#x201c;product&#x201d; was delivered, while simultaneously working with customers to ensure their needs are met.<br>
&#x2022;	DEC UNIX experience adding to an already large background of administering and using UNIX systems.</p>

    <p class="description">Was lead programmer in a group that designed and implemented production control systems for various clients. These systems were written in Progress (a fourth generation language). Also supervised programming enhancements and changes to the system and tested these changes.<br>
<br>
Modified an existing print spooling system written in Cobol and added enhancements for use in the printing of security material. This program was developed on a UNIX system and then transferred to the target system, an IBM 4331 computer, where it was debugged.<br>
<br>
Supervised the typesetting operations at GSI. During this time the typesetting was being done with the TeX system on one of the Plexus UNIX systems. Drafts were being produced on an Apple Laserwriter and final documents were done on a Linotype L300 photo-typesetter. The TeX program was ported to one of the Plexus in the summer of 1986 and has since been maintained and enhanced.</p>
