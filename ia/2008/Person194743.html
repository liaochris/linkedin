            <h2>Valerie Curl&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                As a seasoned marketing communications professional, my 16+ years experience in project and production management has given me the ability to recommend and collaborate on innovative concepts and conceptual formats that senior managers, sales, and clients have praised; develop and maintain aggressive schedules even while projects are changing on a daily basis; create cost-effective budgets that reduce expenditures over previous costs; and manage both internal teams and external resources to execute programs targeting domestic, international and channel markets.  <br>
<br>
In addition, I have worked with product marketing and marketing managers in refining communications strategies and tactical plans for new product launches, lead generation, co-marketing, upsell and direct sell efforts.  I have partnered with and led cross functional teams from across the organization to develop and deploy communications programs that delivered on strategy, on time and within budget...and provided a high rate of return on the investment.<br>
<br>
My background covers a gamut of communications programs, from print and OOH advertising to direct mail, sales and customer promotions, point of sale, product packaging, promotional kits, signage, trade show/event materials, web site redesign, and branding for hardware, software, internet, and financial companies.  Among the companies for whom I've worked are SGI, Maxtor, Borland, Visa, and Working Assets Long Distance.  Plus, I have experience working for agencies on the accounts of many other Silicon Valley companies such as Apple, HP, Macromedia, Fujitsu, Applied Materials, and E*TRADE.<br>
<br>
In my current position as the Director of Production, I lead the print production team, collaborate with art, copy and graphics production on design and execution, negotiate and purchase original art and usage rights, manage the business side of broadcast production, and negotiate with an entirely freelance Creative staff.
