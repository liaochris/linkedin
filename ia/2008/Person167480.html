              <p class="summary">
                An Artist with 19+ yrs of professional working experience in a variety of media and mediums, most of my time has been Drawing comics, followed by design work of varying kinds.<br>

Recently been enjoying opportunities to do editorial illustrations and hope to find more work of this kind.<br>

I've also been fortunate enough to receive recognition from the Canada Council for the Arts in the form of a grant allowing me to complete a Novel length project. <br>
<br>
Occasionally I’ve also worked in film doing storyboards, designed and manufactured props, painted murals, and carved a trade sign or two for local bars. This diversity of experience has given me i think, a unique flexibility and informs much of my work.

    <p class="description">For over 19 years I've worked as a freelance artist, making my living almost entirely with my pens, pencils and wits. <br>
<br>
At this time i enjoy a verity of illustration work, and I'm always available for commissions for magazines, advertising and privet customers. <br>
<br>
In addition i have some decent Design chops and have worked up Logos, Posters, Web pages and other assorted bits of Graphic Design over the years. I also have a fair bit of experience as a Designer for Animation and enjoy that work quite a bit as well.<br>
<br>
And I manage to spend most of my time drawing, and lately writing my first love, Comics. <br>
<br>
I have done that in a Work for Hire capacity in the past for Marvel, DC and other major companies. And while  I'm picky about the sort of work i take on in comics now, i am available for commissions in that form as well.<br>

I'm not a the biggest sci-fi film fanatic, but I watch way more than the average monkey. Of all the properties I'd choose to work on, this is one of the top three I would've picked. Fun stuff as WFH gigs go! <br>
<br>
I worked with an old roll model, artist and writer Ty Templeton, and drew 4 stories in this Slim Line style comic. One of which i was able to color as well. Very enjoyable job.<br>
<br>
The book was extremely well received by POTA fans and critically acclaimed in general.<br>

For this series I got layouts from Kieron; was fun, freed me from a lot of the heavy thinking at that first stage. I was free to work them, make appropriate changes. It was a very comfortable approach, and having Kieron as sometimes foil to bounce things off of was rewarding.<br>
<br>
For the stylized rendering in this book I used Inda ink & wash predominantly, and developed a method from separating the art for 2 color printing - the book was printed on yellowish paper and in a deep, dried blood like red brown; and black ink. Successfully achieving a very intense moody feel.<br>

    <p class="description">In 2002 i revisited the halls of Marvel comics, and worked on two books in the experimental Muties line, stories about mutants who are not superheros. <br>
<br>
I worked on 48 pages in all and did the painted cover art for the last book. For the first on book one of the series, Muties #1of6 'The Changeling', I did brake downs for illustrator Peter Ferguson who painted the book. There my prime job was to work out the story telling and flow of the pages here. the series was all Scripted by Karl Bollers - http://salgoodsam.com/thumbs.html<br>
<br>
On the last, sixth issue of Muties #6 of 6 'The Patriot Game', I did full art chores. I worked closely with Bernie Mireault again to come up with the color pallet and feel of the book. I also got to do an extensive re-write with the writer on this issue, and remain exceptionally pleased with the issue.<br>

48 page graphic novella<br>
Art by Salgood Sam, <br>
Scripted by Glen Hanson & Allan Neuwirth<br>
<br>
This 48pg trade was my First Graphic Novella. Done entirely with a Brush, the art is an intentional stylistic echo of 40's comic art and the drawing traditions of H.G. Peter's original comic. Bernie Mireault & I worked closely to choose a color palate for this book that captured the saturated colors of early comics, & the first Technicolor films.<br>
<br>
The original script would have called for a book that was several times longer to do justice to, and sadly had to be cut short due to preset page counts. The plot shows some odd brevity as a result, the missing development is missed. But despite that it reads well and I feel this book is an overall successes. Took a little longer to get done due to the delays from the script but it all got done in time in the end.<br>

I was fortunate to have a previous working relationship with the head designer, Goran Delic, who put my name in the hat for the gig.<br>
<br>
I received clean-line layouts and was responsible for heavily rendering them with very stylized heavy brush lines, adding a large amount of additional rendering to the art with textures, feathered shading, and a lot of general ink work.<br>

<br>
My book was Saint Sinner, the flag ship title of the line. <br>
<br>
Was very excited, a prestigious gig to get so soon in my carrier. I was not happy with the way things went in the end, but it was a major learning experience for me and I'm proud of much of the art I contributed to the books.<br>

It was the fastest i ever drew i think, did 19 full size [11x17"] pages of art in 10 days. Amazed me and impressed the editors who a month latter asked if I'd like another. <br>
<br>
That  was 'THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY' in Clive Barker’s Night Breed #23, a 32 page story. This one also went fast and i'm still very pleased with a lot of the art i did on it.<br>

      <p class="notes">Largely self taught endlessly active autodidact. Drawing compulsively and making things since I was a child, I attended Wexford CI for 3.5 yrs for their Advanced Arts program. <br>
<br>
Ultimately I have no diplomas, but I come from a family of artists, and have enjoyed the privilege of having many mentors. I've also happily snapped my vintage Nikon F at stuff for over 17yrs, taken repeated and slowly improving stabs at writing, played in B&W dark rooms, cut up collages, produced radio and audio plays, messed with clay, painted paint, and yes, drawn ceaselessly for all my life.<br>
<br>
I’m always open to learning how to use new media and tools, so on the job training is always welcomed as well.</p>
