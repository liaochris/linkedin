<br>
I adapted ITIL’s service support disciplines to our organization and assisted the software developers in integration of the process our integrated ITSM tool (Remedy 7). <br>
<br>
Mapped the existing procedures and checklists to the process and updated as required for immediate use and continuous improvement.  I also gapped the missing essential documentation and worked with our technical writer to complete them.  I designed a document library (in SharePoint) and ensured that a document change management procedure was in place.<br>
 <br>
The tool was successfully released on time with the corresponding process workflows.  I conducted train-the-trainer sessions with the team leads so they could continue to train their teams on the standard.</p>

    <p class="description">When I was hired, the company did not truly have a sales “team” with any established processes, procedures or metrics.  I was hired to create a sales support organization responsible for developing, implementing and measuring processes and procedures for the sales team.  <br>
<br>
One of my challenges was to acquire and implement a Siebel CRM system. A significant benefit of the improved data collection and reporting process was improved visibility into and understanding of our markets, clients, and products.   The result of these efforts was a 100% increase in annual sales – from approximately $12 million to over $25 million.<br>
<br>
In support of the increase of sales, I was tasked with developing an integrated lead generation and sales process. In one year, the sales cycle declined from an average of 18 months to 6 months and the close rate for new sales had doubled.  The overall result of these efforts was a complete turn-around form losing market share to gaining significant market share.</p>

I modified Dr. Robert Cooper’s phase-gate system that included Discovery, Scope, Business Case, Design, Development, Quality Assurance, Pre-Release, and Release activities.  <br>
<br>
The deliverables for the NPI Process and established practical and constant guidelines for deliverables was essential for the Product and Engineering Team. Simplicity was important to accomplish the goal to deliver products on time and to cost and performance standards. I successfully delivered 40+ templates for the lifecycle. I was also responsible for the on-going maintenance of the methodology, deliverables and process for Product Management and Engineering.   <br>
<br>
The rollout of the NPI Process throughout the business was essential. I trained over 500 employees in all areas of the lifecycle resources from finance to sales to operations to client services and all in between.</p>

    <p class="description">Management requested that I take the challenge of a large re-do of USi’s infrastructure and processes.  I was responsible for creating and releasing the business and product development strategy for an Operation Support System in the following products:<br>
<br>
*  USiOasis, the operational support system, which collects information from many sources to help technical teams make intelligent decisions quickly. Engineers can drill down on any device to assess its health, view its history, and monitor current events.<br>
*  USiView, the client-facing portal in USiOasis, which lets the client check their systems at a glance, including status of cases and change requests, backups, server resource utilization, and application-specific monitors and reports.<br>
<br>
I was ultimately responsible for the $.5M Departmental Budget for development and release activities. I reduced operational overhead costs by $3.7M via contract negotiations and $10.2M via product substitution and contract renewals in 6 months.</p>

I identified, analyzed and resolved support deficiencies, then developed and directed corrective action.<br>

At USi, I added ISO compliance and internal auditing to my quality initiative tool bag.  By previously implementing control methods and documentation requirements via CMM standards, passing our ISO audits was a much easier process.<br>
