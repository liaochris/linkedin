I was the manager, designer, and programmer of Mount Sunapee’s web site and email communications. I also managed the structure and strategy for Mount Sunapee's databases. The database solution I planned was designed to make it easier, more efficient and limit the amount of human error when entering the data. The database was also created to give me the ability to easily run exports of new email addresses to continue to grow our email universe. During my time with Mount Sunapee I increased their email list universe from 1,000 members to 15,000 members in a four-month period.</p>

I had three designers working with me, and was responsible for managing their efforts on their various projects as well as maintaining my own work flow as well.
