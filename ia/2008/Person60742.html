            <h2>Erin Cronican&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have been coaching actors in the business of acting for more than 6 years, but have been involved in theater as an actor almost longer than I can remember. I had my first juicy stage role at the age of 9 (as the Gander in "Charlotte's Web"), and followed my passion all the way to Pepperdine University, where I received my degree in Theater (Acting Emphasis, with classes in Directing). I began acting professionally straight out of school in San Diego's bustling theater scene but also put my business side to work in the sales and marketing departments of a national advertising magazine publisher.<br>
<br>
In 2001 I decided to bring my two disciplines, marketing and theater, together to help San Diego actors reach their goals. My first coaching venture was "Auditions Made Simple", an audition/interview coaching service for high school students applying for college theater/film programs. Almost immediately I branched out to include coaching for adults and found that the need for business training is paramount in the acting industry.<br>
<br>
In mid 2002 I was brought on as Communications & Member Services Director at the Actors Alliance of San Diego, a non-profit service organization dedicated to the advancement, exposure and education of the San Diego theater artist. Through AASD, I discovered that I could use my skills to serve actors of all levels, and thus closed my private coaching service in favor of supporting actors at the community level. <br>
<br>
Since moving to New York in 2005, I have been steadily working in SAG, AFTRA and AEA projects, including the title role in the independent feature film "Playing Doctor" and 2 roles in the brand new musical "Fritz and Froyim." I am very excited to bring my skills and insights to New York actors in a format that is inspiring, inexpensive and effective.<br>
