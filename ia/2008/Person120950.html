            <h2>Marieke Evertsen&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                After 10 years in IT, working in various positions ranging from system engineer to European Data Centre Manager, it was time to make a complete career change. I have decided to go back to my roots and am now the owner of my own travel agency. <br>
<br>
Even though the tourism industry differs from IT, my main goals and challenges have not changed. I am still about delivering the best service possible, except now this means making sure people (either being it a family, group of friends, business, etc.) are having the best vacation or other travel related time that they can remember. <br>
<br>
In my newly started business, I will be able to further develop my communication skills, be inventive and learn all there is to know about owning one's own business.<br>

As one of my specialties is creating order out of chaos, this was something I happily started working on. With my background in IT and my people and communication skills, I managed to turn around the operations team and gained more responsibility by also leading he other IT teams working out of Venlo, NL (E-Commerce engineering, Technical Services, Networks & Telecommunications and Operational Support). For the last year, the IT department and myself focused on implementing SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) into the daily work flow.</p>
