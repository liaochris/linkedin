              <p class="summary">
                Greetings,<br>
My name is Tim Hale and I own Infinity Fotos, an award-winning, veteran-owned small business founded in 2003 with the sole purpose of providing high quality photography ranging from sports action to location portraiture. <br>
<br>
Even though the company is young, I've been involved in photography since 1979. Since that time, years of practical experience have led to a distinctive photojournalistic style. <br>
<br>
The key is to bring the viewer to the instant - that moment in time captured forever. Whether it be a game-winning play or a cherished image of a loved one, the moment only happens once. <br>
<br>
Let me put my professionalism and experience to work for you today.
              </p>
