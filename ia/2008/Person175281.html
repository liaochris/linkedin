            <h2>Shiri Dori&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I'm a young, highly motivated Computer Science developer. I've been participating in excellence programs since I was nine years old, and have always tapped my curiosity and comprehension skills to learn, understand and go beyond, to ask further questions and make suggestions. I'm a quick learner and a sharp observer, and my long-retained memory ensures that I rarely forget something I've learned. I'm often told that I have a very bubbly personality.<br>
<br>
I am always happy to help others, and am a serial volunteer, with past experiences in a hospital children's ward, with a blind student, and with a Junior Academic Staff Organization. I am always on the lookout for ways to give back to the community, and one way I do so is teaching.<br>
<br>
Here's my vision of a perfect work-environment: first and foremost, in a supportive team. When you work with people that you get along with, your results are immensely better, by bouncing ideas off others, and getting feedback for your work. In the long run, I would also like to have a job which involves me teaching or guiding in some way. It's important for me to find a job that I will be passionate about and interested in. When I feel excited about a project, I tend to be extremely motivated and really do my absolute best. Which, if I may say so myself, is not too shabby.<br>
<br>
Right now, my expertise lies with String Matching algorithms, with a year's experience at Answers.com. I'm excited now to consider my options for the future.<br>
<br>
And for fun? I'm an all-out bookworm, love puzzles and music, especially Tori Amos - whom I met in person in summer 2007! Sluggy (www.sluggy.com) makes my day. I used to be a huge LEGO fan and am slowly reclaiming my bricks from my parents' house. I'm also crazy about my niece, Carmel, born Feb. 2005.<br>
<br>
I speak both Hebrew and English as native tongues.<br>
<br>
To receive recommendations from my direct and senior managers in any position, please contact me and I will make the connection between you.

    <p class="description">For most of my time in Answers.com, I was part of the back-end team, and responsible for a module called Unification. I brought the module up from a fairly bug-ridden state to a nearly bug-free, extremely reliable state. I designed and implemented new features, in close coordination with the Content team and other engineers. I took an active role in prioritizing tasks and long-term projects.<br>
<br>
Whenever possible, I took initiative in Engineering-wide issues such as code cleanup, coding conventions, modeling, performance and testing.<br>
<br>
I programmed in Java on JBoss servers, working against a MySQL database.</p>

    <p class="description">I worked for a grant in the Stringology group with my advisor, Prof. Gad M. Landau. Together, we pursued a topic worth of an article within a month. We wrote a paper which has since been published in a refereed conference, and an expanded version was published in Information Processing Letters. I lectured about it in front of over a hundred accomplished researchers in the field - both in the Second Haifa Annual International Stringology Research Workshop, and in the Sixteenth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, which was held in Korea; proceeding were published in LNCS. Read the paper here: <br>

    <p class="description">I taught two courses, Data Structures and Database Management Systems. Data Structures is a core course, taught every semester with about fifty students in two groups each term. DBMS is an elective, and is taught every other term. It is a very popular course, limited to eighty students in two groups on a first-come, first-serve basis.<br>
<br>
I think patience and caring are the most important traits a teacher can have, and my students often feel the same. I encouraged them to approach me with any question, comment or problem, and I devoted my time to help them in any way I could.</p>

    <p class="description">During my last year of bachelor studies, I held a student position at IBM Haifa. I worked in the Software Asset Management (SAM) group, which consisted of eighteen people, with smaller working teams of two to four people. My job responsibility was research and development in Java.<br>
<br>
The first project was a prototype developed for research purposes. My team leader and I researched the topic, and presented our prototype to the collaborating team in IBM Watson. I developed the prototype engine back-end. <br>
<br>
In the WebSphere Studio Asset Analyzer project, I was responsible for a component named Pattern Detector. In six months, I brought the component into working order: testing, fixing bugs, and documenting. In addition, I upgraded the component for compatability with WebSphere Application Server 5.0 and 5.1. I also took part in some tasks in the project at large.</p>

    <p class="description">I edited the seminal book about Object-Process Methodology (OPM), and offered comments on both the editorial and content level. I suggested reordering of the chapters, to supply a more gentle introduction for the average user or student, and postpone theoretical discussions to the final chapters.<br>
I composed the problems appearing at the end of each chapter, which enhance the book as a textbook in graduate or advanced undergraduate courses such as systems architecture, or specification and analysis of information systems. OPM is currently taught in leading universities around the world, including the Technion and MIT.<br>

My contribution is acknowledged in the preface of the book.<br>

      <p class="notes">From early graduation at an American High School, I went straight to Haifa University where I widened the scope of my knowledge through the Ofakim Excellence program, which allowed me to study such diverse topics as philosophy, history, geography and more. This was in addition to Computer Science studies: I studied both theoretical courses such as data structures, algorithms, and computability; and practical courses such as databases, operating systems, and computer structure. I programmed several small-scale projects, and a medium-sized Toy File System. I gained experience in team programming (similar to eXtreme Programming), which was one of the coolest times of my life - I learned a lot about myself and how I interact with people. I programmed mostly in C++.<br>
<br>
I graduated with honors with a 93 point average in both Computer Science and the Ofakim program.</p>
