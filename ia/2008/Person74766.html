            <h2>Marcel Kampman&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Studied Graphic Design at Academy Minerva, School for Fine Art & Design in Groningen and started to work as designer during the 1st year of his study. Since he has a healthy natural appetite to constantly learn more and further develop himself he always has initiated projects and investigated new disciplines.<br>
<br>
He worked for the music industry making artwork and music videos for bands and meanwhile kept combining the experience from all those projects with eachother to create new projects.<br>
<br>
One of the results was the founding of Texelse Boys in 1999, a non-commercial platform for boundless creativity. Creative people from all thinkable fields from all around the world work experiment together on this platform to make creative work beyond their expertise. This led to e.g. an own tv-show, radio broadcasts, performances, new music, videos and a festival in a festival in 2005: Texelse Boys Playground at the Lowlands festival. <br>
<br>
Joined Mattmo concept | design in 2002 as senior designer and worked as freelancer on the side. In 2005 he switched to ...,staat to further develop his skills in the field of brand communication as concept/art director. Also in 2005, he presented his modular bookshelf system 'A+B' at the most important furniture fair in the world, the Salone Internazionale del Mobile in Milan.<br>
<br>
In 2006 he was asked to set up, lead, and teach at a brand new department at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, Interactive / Media / Design. In September he made a switch to Fabrique help set up and be part of a new cross media team in Amsterdam as creative director. He's the founder of the new creative conference 'Mastermundo'. The first edition has been held in September 2007, the second edition is currently in development.<br>
<br>
In 2008, he joined the board of the Association of Dutch Designers (BNO) and switched from Fabrique to Waacs Design & Consultancy in Rotterdam.

    <p class="description">Mastermundo is an annual conference for sharing passion, knowledge, ideas and inspiration. It is organized with, by and for students of I/M/D and also open to everyone else interested.<br>
<br>
Speakers are part of the 'Pool of Masterminds' or invited guests. The Pool is a ever-expanding group of people from outside the Royal Academy of Art. What all these people have in common is an endless passion and drive for what they do. So much, that they don’t mind sharing their knowledge with a new breed of designers. Because they understand the relevance of passing on knowledge and know that they themselves can create new ideas just as easily as sharing them.<br>
<br>
The Pool consists of a wide variety of creative people like designers, architects, illustrators, writers, journalists, artists, movie makers, marketing and advertising professionals to even lawyers.</p>
