            <h2>David Newman, D.Sc.&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Dr. Newman noticed that many people had the entrepreneurial spirit, but lacked the education and business experience to realize their vision of creating a profitable company. This fact was proven in Quebec, Canada where they answered the entrepreneurial need by establishing a government agency that would fund start-up companies.  The result was an absolute disaster; companies were funded with poor business plans and unqualified management teams that lacked experience in running a business.  In light of the inadequate resources available through universities, and the lack of expertise being offered by organizations that are experienced in building  businesses from the ground up,  Dr. Newman decided to fill the void 1998 by providing the training and skills needed to start one's own business and grow it successfully. Dr. Newman proved his concept by accepting a contract as Executive Officer with a start-up company in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Dr. Newman arrived into the company when it had 6 employees, including the owner, and a grand total of $20,000 in annual sales.  Within  one year of bringing Dr. Newman aboard and being guided by his leadership and tutelage, the company gained an additional 150 employees, was totally debt-free, and boasted $2,000,000 USD cash in the bank and in excess of $150,000 USD in sales per day.  Dr. Newman's varied experience was accrued not only within the shores of North America, but in 17 other countries worldwide, and he is acutely aware of how business differs between cultures and countries.  Dr. Newman is a master at bridging the cultural differences, and has never allowed a business to fail at accomplishing every milestone of its business plan.  .
