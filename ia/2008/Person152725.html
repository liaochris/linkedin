            <h2>Piero Pollesello&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I started my career as a PhD research scientist with a background in chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology. After moving to Finland, I lectured at the University of Helsinki (Faculty of medicine) and become docent (senior lecturer/adjunct professor). Thereafter I moved to Orion Pharma and became head of the cardiovascular drug discovery research and later of the structural biology group. During this period, I substantially contributed to the discovery, patenting, development, registration and launch of SIMDAX. As a manager, I had been leading a unit of ten subordinates for four years and coordinated the job of the whole cardiovascular drug discovery in the matrix organization.<br>
In my early scientific career I published more than 60 full papers in international journals, several book chapters, and more than 70 other scientific contributions (among which 8 patents). For my know-how and communication skills I have been often asked to lecture on the mechanism of action of drugs at international congresses and meetings. I have a broad and strong network of opinion leaders, which I used for evaluation of drug discovery and development projects. Finally, I cooperated as evaluator in the European Union framework project FP6 in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005.<br>
Following a job switch in 2003 from drug discovery to the strategic marketing, I attended the Medical Business Strategy Program of the Scandinavian International Management Institute and broaden my understanding of the medical products business.  I have now deep insights into the overall Pharma business also from the financial side and contributed to the creation and managing of strategic planning for discovery, development, marketing and sales of proprietary drug portfolios. After attending a course for B2C & B2B branding I was appointed Global Brand Manager for Cardiology & Critical Care Proprietary products (SIMDAX and PRECEDEX)
