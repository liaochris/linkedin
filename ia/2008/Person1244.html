    <p class="description">The primary function of the CMRP (Centralized Mortgage Renewal Dept.) revolved around the retention of existing mortgage clients in an economic period, which allowed for substantial competition from all the financial institutions. My role with CMRP sought to further the objectives and meet the retention and sales targets of the group. It involved contacting existing mortgage clients by telephone and entering into negotiations with individual clients in order to retain mortgage products. In this role, I was successful in retaining a large number of clients and meeting all of my sales, service and activity targets while in that role.</p>

    <p class="description">As part of the contact centre environment, instances occur where clients require the services of senior members of the team in order to rectify and/or correct any problems that may have occurred. My promotion to the role of Senior Credit Officer with the Client escalation group required that I intervene in situations where the contact centre member and the client were incapable to resolving the concern or where attempts made to so only further exacerbated the situation. I would clarify the position of American Express vis-à-vis the client and work with the client to resolve the problem in a timely and efficient manner. I met and exceeded my targets as well as maintained customer satisfaction ratings of very good to excellent.</p>

    <p class="description">The credit and collections division of American Express EE involved two distinct streams for which I had the fortune of working in. The primary function involved collections related duties in both a personal and commercial portfolio. My role required that I contact clients telephonically in order to determine and make payment arrangements with existing clients in order to restore the credit worthy status of the borrowers. In this respect, I would deal with clients whose repayment lapses ranged from 1 to 360 days with an aim of restoring borrowing privileges as soon as possible. As a secondary function, I would be involved in the review and assessment of existing borrowers in good standing whose borrowing requirements had changed and were increasing due to various factors. In order to make sound and reasonable credit decision, I would review sources of income, cash-flow information, credit history and potential funds use as part of my decision process.</p>

      <p class="notes">I examined the connection between international bank supervision and Islamic banking, specifically, how to supervise & regulate an Islamic bank in a conventional environment. I argue that because Islamic banking differs from conventional banking, & because a hard law supervisory approach would frustrate attempts to level the playing field, the way forward lies with the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision. The BCBS is premised on a decentralized approach to cross border supervision. Managed effectively, the BCBS serves as a model for transnational cooperation, making regulation of Islamic banks an obvious candidate. However, the BCBS does not regulate Islamic banks. The  recommendation involves the BCBS as facilitator of supervisory guidelines for Islamic banking. This requires the creation of a semi autonomous body (Islamic Banking Supervisory Committee) within the BCBS developing a supervisory programme that recognizes the differences and fosters competition & fair market practices.</p>

      <p class="notes">Many experts are estimating the growth of the Islamic Finance industry at more than 20% per annum with some experts predicting that in the future, the Islamic Finance industry could become a major competitor to the conventional finance industry. <br>
<br>
Aimed at new and existing investment professionals specialising in Sharia’a compliant finance, trade, investment and insurance, the IFQ will primarily be a practical Islamic banking qualification, but will also cover the legal aspects of Sharia’a which underpins all Islamic contracts.</p>
