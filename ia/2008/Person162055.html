            <h2>Robert Erickson&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                1. I love to learn. Whatever the subject, I will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting. I am energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence.<br>
<br>
2. I sort through the clutter and find the best route. To my knowledge, it is not a skill that can be taught. It is a distinct way of thinking, a special perspective on the world at large. This perspective allows me to see patterns where others simply see complexity. Mindful of these patterns, I play out alternative scenarios, always asking what if? Ignoring paths that lead nowhere, I select a strategy and strike forward.<br>
<br>
3. Things happen for a reason. In my soul I know that we are all connected. We are individuals, responsible for our own judgments and in possession of our own free will, but we are part of something larger. We are not isolated from one another or from the earth and the life on it. If we are all part of a larger picture, then we must not harm others because we will be harming ourselves. We must not exploit because we will be exploiting ourselves.<br>
<br>
4. Excellence, not average, is my measure. Taking something from below average to slightly above average takes a great deal of effort and is not very rewarding. Transforming something strong into something superb takes just as much effort but is much more thrilling. Strengths, whether mine or someone else's, fascinate me and I am attracted to others who have found and cultivated their own strengths. I avoid those who want to "fix" me and make me well rounded. I don't want to spend my life bemoaning what I may lack. <br>
<br>
5. I am intrigued by the unique qualities of each person. I hear the one-of-a-kind stories in each person's life. I know instinctively that the secret to great teams is casting everyone so that they can do a lot of what they do well.
