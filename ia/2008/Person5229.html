            <h2>Alan Johnson&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am currently involved in identifying and pursuing new investment, business and product opportunities.  Primarily, I try to adapt to the financial markets the concepts and principles I learned during my 30+ years in business development within the chemical industry. <br>
<br>
A recent interest of mine is the concept of risk, reward, and regret as presented in the recent book "The Rules of Risk" by Ron S. Dembo and Andrew Freeman.  I have found it to be an easier task to quantify these concepts for investments in the equity markets than it is to develop these same assessments for investments in early-stage business and product opportunities.<br>
<br>
An ongoing interest of mine is to successfully apply these principles to investments in financial instruments.  I welcome the exchange of ideas in this area.
              </p>

    <p class="description">Infineum is a 50/50 joint venture between ExxonMobil and Shell formed in 1999 when these two companies merged their respective fuel and lubricant additives businesses.<br>
<br>
Core business activities include additives to improve cold flow (pour point and CFPP using MDFI) and lubricity properties of diesel fuel.  The increasing trend in using vegetable oils (soybean, palm, rapeseed, etc) and animal fats (e.g. tallow) to produce biodiesel results in challenges as well as opportunities for this business.<br>
<br>
Other areas of focus include aviation jet fuel additives, crude oil flow improvers, dewaxing aids, and other early stage initiatives.<br>
<br>
The tools and techniques I use to identify and develop opportunities include disruptive innovation (Christensen), Front End of Innovation (FEI), Stage Gate, Value Mapping, Price Waterfalls, and Voice of Customer.</p>
