            <h2>Jeff Hardee&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                After serving in the military and completing my B.A., I have worked in the IT industry for over a decade in help desk, systems administration, and network engineering positions.  In addition to these positions, I hosted an IT radio show on a local AM station for a few months, taught a variety of IT subjects in the classroom for close to a year, and I mentored students and taught courses at one of the premier on-line learning companies.  Currently, I work as a Senior Network Administrator at Orbital Sciences where I provide a wide range of network administration services from managing hardware to implementing security.<br>
<br>
I consider myself to be at the intermediate stage of my career in IT, with a solid base of skills and a plan for future development.  I'm currently digging deeper into networking and security and I continue to expand my writing credits with various projects.  I'm also completing a Master of Science in Technology degree, specializing in Global Technology and Development.  My thesis examines the cultural aspects of digital movie piracy.  I strive to be active in various IEEE societies as well, allowing me to examine my field from multiple angles.<br>
<br>
I enjoy the changing nature of IT and am glad to be a part of its evolution.  Although I don't expect to master every aspect of technology, I do strive to be highly competent in my chosen areas of expertise, as well as to communicate those areas to the average user in informative and enjoyable ways.
