    <p class="description">This was a part-time position I held with Target Corporation in its headquarter call center operation while freelancing.  Customer Service has always been a huge part of just about any position I have held in the past, and my time at Target helped me excel even more.  <br>
<br>
Target's training is incredible, and after my promotion to the crisis communications team, I learned more about human interaction and behavior than I thought possible.  Additionally, since I always have an eye toward marketing, learning how one of the country's best retail firms designed and marketed its brand messaging to both internal and external customers was like taking a Master's class from some of the best in the industry!</p>

During my time in the plant I worked a swing shift and learned all aspects of the candymaking process.  This including everything from making the chocolate to packing and shipping.  Aside from learning first-hand what it is like to work inside the manufacturing facility of a major consumer goods company, working for M&M Mars marked the beginning of my passion for developing process improvements in all the work I do.</p>
