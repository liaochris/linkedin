            <h2>Richard Tabor Greene&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I have developed the most comprehensive, practical curriculum in creativity applied to invention, discovery, design, and business venturing in the world--92 courses, all tested on my Chinese and Japanese undergrads.  I can transform passive East Asians into innovative Americans. <br>
<br>
I am gradually redoing major design areas, putting them on a scientific research-able basis, by grounding them in my 60 models of creativity (see scribd.com for an article presenting all 60).   <br>
<br>
I am establishing a publishing-of-readings new industry of publishing, where classic and specialist readings of texts and related books on a topic area are published as works in their own right, getting around derivative work areas of copyright law by certain innovative treatments of topic ordering and naming.   <br>
<br>
I set up mass workshop events, such as my Invent Events in which sets of 200 people in 3 days generate 100 patents for a firm.   These events are 40 or more workshops daily going on in parallel with each workshop making a different product, using procedures derived from world best experts, and the products combining to make powerful overall results.   <br>
<br>
I have invented a new technology of meeting, face to face and across electronic networks, called Social Automata, wherein excitement replaces boredom in meetings.   It is based on using people as if processors in a parallel array of computers, assigning particular mental roles to them, and linking the roles in interesting topologies to maximize quality.   <br>
<br>
I have invented certain regularized fractal interfaces, one to replace all prose writing, another to replace web 2.0 browsers, another to replace current workgroup electronic cooperation topologies.   <br>
<br>
Structural cognition is a set of methods I have invented for allowing people to apply ordinary mental operators to 64 or 128 ideas, in the same time and with the same quality of outcome as they now apply those operators to 4 or 6 ideas.
              </p>

              <p class="skills">
                I am a life changing public speaker--over half my U of C MBAs said so.   I am an inspirational leader who distributes management functions using structured workshop events that get employees to apply management functions to themselves. I wrote 16,800 pages of methods books for educatedness, effectiveness, creativity, managing complexity, managing culture, managing self, managing cities, super selling, managing technological innovation, 45 models of innovation, 64 dynamics of hi tech ventures.

    <p class="description">My undergrads read 116 English graduate level research books, structurally diagramming 50 main points from two key chapters in each in their junior year and making presentations on chapter contents their senior year.   The same books get read twice, once in 3rd and once in 4th year.   9 books I wrote are included in the 116.  4000 books organized under 450 of my interests (posted on scridb) are used to assist thesis work.  My students go to only the world's top ten universities for grad school, averaging 800 on GRE math and 800 on Toefl Writing exams.   My seminar involves leadership and creativity and mastering the five common cultures of business that enfeeble innovation in businesses: male culture, American, technology culture, monkey hierarchy culture, and capitalism culture.   96 particular methods of effectiveness from 150 of the world's most effective people are mastered by these students in the three years of my research seminar.</p>

    <p class="description">Life coaches do psychoanalysis without encumberment by Freud's manias.   I review pharmologic, brain neurology, social psych, and other research on determinants of human feelings, reactions, and behaviors and supply clients with specific theories and frameworks that make the world they see and their possible actions in it larger than for those without such theories and frames.   This unsticks people trapped in less than they want, or in hurting themselves and others.   Mid-life crises, values implosions, unattended to career aspirations--the whole human gamut is my treatment area. <br>
<br>
I specialize in restoring composing arts and performing them to lives trapped in spectatorship, viewing, and other passivities of our commercial central broadcast media cultures.    I also restore to professional artists and performers, grounding of their art in real lived human experiences--lost as the performer lifestyle ruins performer lives and traps performers in fake or drug pseudo-experience.</p>

    <p class="description">I do product, graphic, event, interface, technology design--all based on my 60 models of creativity and 128 steps to becoming a creator.   My enemy is mere insight based designing--I have data proving the superiority of my designs in customer and market impact.   My designs are grounded in creativity theory and practices.   <br>
<br>
I also do fashion design with the lines Kimono SportFormal Fashions, Casual Celebrity, and Global Warming Suits.   These are all based on research in design dimensions derived from models of creativity.   <br>
<br>
I also design events, interfaces, and technologies using fractal interface and social indexing events and concepts.    <br>
<br>
Since I wear my own fashion designs you can judge for yourself by meeting me--keep in mind by walking around in Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons hotels I usually sell a hundred times my room charges.</p>

    <p class="description">Hired to save Baldrige Award application because IT has nothing to show examiners--I set up 40 high technology circles, and quickly impressed the examiners with 40 workgroups of ordinary employees learning artificial intelligence programming.   <br>
<br>
Used total quality process to spec software for a Taguchi application, the result a front end and back end to competitor Taguchi applications (when they sold one of theirs I sold one of mine = effortless market dominance).   I interviewed Genichi Taguchi in Japanese to extract his optimization strategies for the software.  <br>

Founded the High Performance Work Center, the 1st presentation at Xerox PARC's first Document Symposium of top Xerox 400 managers.   This software automated work processes, both the in meeting processes and the outside-of-meeting processes of work.   It used structured conversations to capture process knowledge from ordinary employees and turned that into code automatically, the performance of which employees edited.</p>

    <p class="description">Research questions:<br>
(1) TQM totalized a body of knowledge, quality knowledge, 33 ways; what other bodies of knowledge benefit from those totalizations?  <br>
(2) Quality totalization (6 Sigma) was followed by 20 globalizations in Japan; what other bodies of knowledge benefit from globalizations?  <br>
(3) TQM became THE theory of how to apply info tech to businesses; what do 33 totalizations &amp; 20 globalizations do to software ventures &amp; systems?<br>
(4) Just-in-Time leadership replaces fixed expensive inventories of managers, a social class, as a way to deliver leadership functions; how convert class means with event means to deliver these functions? <br>
(5) events replace processes which replaced departments; what is the optimal weave of e-mediated contact with event based contact? <br>
(6) discussions/meetings follow ancient habits, new social automata arrangements use people as if processors in fixed arrays--what social automata types outproduce traditional discussions/meetings the most?</p>

    <p class="description">When I joined, people were selling two half million dollar each software AI projects to Wall Street firms a year for $1million average per partner in sales.   These were large projects that did not come in in time and none were profitable.   I fixed this immediately by selling 30 $100,000 each shorter simpler less risky projects to drug firms in New Jersey, then to Wall Street firms in Manhattan.   I toured companies, interviewed managers, spotted 30 application AI could do, got volunteer workgroups to extract the needed knowledge, set up 4 hours of weekly training and two programming weeks where expert programmers put that knowledge into code.  The result I sold two $3million projects my first year--six times the best previous sales by partners.</p>

    <p class="description">2000 sales persons had sold nothing to GM, EDS's largest customer (and owner) in 2 years.   I was hired as programmer but I instead tackled the biggest problem my company had without authority or budget.   I reversed the male militarist culture of EDS that was making sales fail and invented a Solution Culture, that was feminine--listening not talking, admitting weakness not bragging about self greatness, praising customer expertise not bragging about own expertise, etc.    We created one day mass workshop events of 30 GM engineers presenting possible AI project solutions to this year GM priorities in the morning, each matched by working software application demos from non-EDS companies in the afternoon.  Remarks by viewing GM managers were transcribed and published to top 2000 managers of the  GM division.  Result, after 3 events, $16 million in software sales, the first sales by anyone other than Ross Perot.   As a result Ross flew me personally to Langley to work with superspooks.</p>

    <p class="description">While studying for 3 grad degrees at U of Michigan I consulted when possible.  Procter &amp; Gamble heard a Yankee group presentation I made on Japan entering US markets and they were amazed at me learning things from my years in Japan that their managers did not learn.    I was hired to tell them how to keep Kao out of P&amp;G's North American markets.   I did a video, shown to some managers till the chairman of Kao bought Jerkins and stood on its front saying he would bury P&amp;G in 20 years.  That made my video popular with vice-chairman Laco who mandated that all see it.  We took videos of P&amp;G managers defensively denying the message of a Japan threat, and that  changed the culture and provoked P&amp;G's initiative to wed systems with Walmart before Kao does that.    I started the initiative to link systems with Walmart with my videos--I did not do that without help.</p>

    <p class="description">I asked Huston Smith (of Dalai Lama fame) at MIT for an organization &quot;rebuilding Western civilization&quot;.  He gave me a phone number in Framingham, Mass.  I joined and visited 50 different North American cities each year, visiting the 20 richest families per city, raising funds, for three years.   Then I designed workshop procedures for mass workshop events of 2000 people meeting in 200 parallel daily workshops for 30 consecutive days.    I also set up participatory town meetings in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and parts of Europe.   I doubled per capita income of Korea's poorest village by importing portable mowers that ended harvest suffering for 7 weeks/year of village women and cash income the thusly liberated women got caused envy in men which caused men to get interested in other development tactics.</p>

    <p class="description">1. If, knowing when and where someone was raised and educated, you can predict nothing at all about what he does, thinks, and believes, he is an educated man. 2. If a man likes being a man &amp; trusts in his male-ness, he is dangerous, a bomb waiting to go off, he cannot in any way be trusted. If a man doubts males, is suspicious of their worth &amp; ways, he is valuable and can be trusted. If an American likes being an American and automatically &amp; easily uses their ways--he is extremely dangerous and cannot be trusted. If, to the contrary, he worries about being misled by his own American-ness and every few minutes takes concrete actions to keep it limited and at bay, under his control, he is wonderful and can be trusted. Anyone who easily and automatically is himself, is a threat, a danger to us all. 3. There are at least 60 diverse models of what being creative is--actions taken to make yourself &quot;more creative&quot; if based on no particular model, undo more creation than they create.</p>

      <p class="notes">Took a John Holland genetic algorithm course and found it full of sycophancy,  learned lots about male hormones and their ability to suppress brain subsystems.  Found that the Santa Fe Institute was being created and went there, participating in nearly all the early symposia, learning complexity theory a decade before magazines made it topical.  Found in theories of history writing how contemporary frameworks greatly distort and limit amounts of historic contents available in history writings.   We see the past through current concerns, concepts, biases.  We project a story of what &quot;went on then and there&quot; rather than &quot;perceiving&quot; what went on then and there.</p>

      <p class="notes">I went to Wellesley to counter MIT's somewhat juvenile overly male culture and to investigate the sexual possibilities of a campus with many women and few men.  I was not disappointed.   I lived within a female culture quite different than MIT's getting insight into strengths of MIT's culture and into correctives for its weaknesses.   <br>
<br>
Elizabeth Prettyman for Shakespeare, Robert Pinsky for poetry, W. H.
