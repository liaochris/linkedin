            <h2>Ad Blankestijn&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Ad Blankestijn feels at home in both Japan and Europe and has always been going back and forth between West and East. He has immersed himself in Japanese culture and he is fluent in Japanese on a near-native level.<br>
<br>
Ad Blankestijn was born in the Netherlands and received his M.A. in Chinese languages and cultures (Japanese was his 2nd subject) with honors at Leiden University. During his studies, he spent one year at Nanjing University and, after graduating, 2 years on a Mombusho Scholarship in Japan, mostly at Kyoto University.<br>
<br>
After teaching at the Sinological Institute of Leiden University, Ad joined the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency (NFIA) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. He was posted to the Netherlands Embassy in Tokyo as part of a team of Japanese and Dutch assigned with attracting Japanese companies to the Netherlands. His sphere of work was therefore business, rather than government. In total, Ad has worked for 20 years in various positions in the NFIA, mostly in Tokyo. His assignment in Japan was concluded by working for 6 years as Embassy Counselor and Head of the NFIA Japan Office. While working for the NFIA, Ad was involved as advisor in many major investments by well-known Japanese companies.  <br>
<br>
During more than 20 years in Japan, Ad has traveled widely and soaked up Japanese culture in all its aspects, ancient and modern. Ad has translated a Japanese novel, Chinese poetry and prose, as well as written reviews on Japanese literature for major newspapers. He writes a blog about Japanese culture, www.japannavigator.com.<br>
<br>
In 2007 Ad returned to Japan to work as Special Advisor for the NFIA, as well as at the same time start a new career as consultant. <br>
<br>
Ad now works as consultant for Japan Intercultural Consulting, an international training and consulting firm focused on Japanese business. He is also active in the promotion of Japanese sake and food culture. In addition, he has become an officially certified guide and interpreter.
