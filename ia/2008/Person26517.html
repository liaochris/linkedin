            <h2>Brant Stevens&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                I am a broad-based, results-oriented, senior executive with extensive experience in solution based, Enterprise Software, Outsourcing Services, Sales and Marketing management. I have demonstrated success in small/medium sized, growth oriented companies and have a deep commitment to building excellence in sales organizations. Through my career I have consistently produced outstanding results through my people skills, team building capabilities and organizational focus on the bottom line. My teams have a record of building enduring client relations that have had a major impact on revenue growth.<br>
<br>
The last 6-7 years of my career have been spent either as a VP of Sales for larger, leading ISV firms (Sterling Commerce), where, for over 3 years, I managed a $150+mm business with 150+ staff members, or in interim /transitional assignments serving as a P&L accountable, SVP of Sales and Marketing with smaller Technology firms and helping them with a liquidity event. I have had significant experience in the world of eCommerce, document management, CRM, storage/data management and secure data delivery. I have worked in a broad variety of vertical markets (including Banking/finance, Insurance, Health Care, Manufacturing, Retail and CPG) with particular strength in the consultative selling of enterprise software. I have extensive reach and understanding in the world of Corporate "C" level executives through my work at dakota imaging, Sterling Commerce, Mobius Management Systems, Goal Systems, and UCCEL. I have 20 years of experience selling and managing sales efforts into the enterprise computing world. I have traveled extensively with all of my work opportunities and have managed international operations.<br>
<br>
I currently live in Baltimore and work in the Detroit area but, I am open to relocation for the right opportunity.
