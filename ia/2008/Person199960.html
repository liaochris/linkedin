In this role I was tasked with the continual increase in the sales of Online LIVE (LIVE Virtual Classroom) and Online ANYTIME (Self-paced eLearning) throughout the New Horizons Network.  The eLearning Program at New Horizons had four main challenges.  The first was Sales Execution, the second was Technology, the third was Support, and the fourth was the Business Model.  My challenge was to help solve and overcome these challenges and gain the confidence of the network to sell eLearning in addition to classroom learning.  Also managed vendor relationships from a sales perspective with Thomson NETg, ElementK, and Skillsoft (Books 24x7).</p>
