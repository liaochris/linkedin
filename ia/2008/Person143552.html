<br>
Details:<br>
I am currently working on the implementation of a new layer of internal financial reports. Our team is developing the process and testing the results of implementation of various methodologies to redesign the presentation of the original GL information and create meaningful and relatively easy to use decision support tools. This internal reporting overhaul was triggered by the need of the management to look at the business from a different perspective. The challenges arise from coordinating multiple systems with little or no common reporting structure as well as dealing with the time lags generated from the complex multi-system environment. I am using Oracle Financial Services products as well as Insight, Excel and Access in my daily work.</p>

My daily work included managing a complex mix of activities – business development, handling targeted acquisition orders, opinions of value, performance analysis, alternative investment presentations, negotiation, research, and education. Since our clients came from diverse industries I needed to constantly improve my knowledge about various types of business operations.  Another aspect of my work included building a successful exit strategy for current business owners by applying solutions to improve the marketability and value of their businesses – for example, business development planning, restructuring of operations, mapping out a seamless business transfer process to ensure continuity of operations and smooth transition to new ownership.</p>

Details:<br>
SunGard is a leader in the financial software and processing solutions industry.  The uniqueness of the challenge came from the requirement to find a person with the appropriate mix of financial expertise and technical skills needed for taking over the building and maintenance of the whole portfolio of internal financial reports. While working at SunGard I was in charge of maintaining and building internal P&L reports, revenue forecasts, foreign exchange (FX) and budget variance reports. Due to the nature of my work I was also given access to highly confidential information, including payroll and commissions data. My work on the revenue analysis and projection models included calculation and planning of revenues and commissions by type or channel. That data was also used for resource allocation and planning (consultants required for new implementations, etc).</p>

Details:<br>
Nestle Co-Mfg Finance needed an experienced consultant to build and maintain templates for month-end production reporting and usage reconciliations. Starting with no process and documentation in place I had to interview other financial analysts in similar functions to recreate the workflow, create routine procedures, build new templates for month end reporting and reconciliations, establish relationships with key IT and financial personnel and build a departmental operations manual. After the successful completion of all tasks I trained a financial analyst to take over my functions and gradually transferred all responsibilities. To ensure undisrupted operations in the event of any personnel changes I also cross-trained the data entry person and the department head to handle all critical daily tasks.</p>

The most challenging assignment I had was to take a leadership role in developing the operations processes in a high-visibility CRM project for Microsoft. I built conflict resolution scripts and escalation scenarios for handling senior executive calls from Fortune 500 companies. I also worked on identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and analyzing current call center performance against the benchmarks agreed upon at project inception in the Business Requirements Documents (BRD). My work was an exceptional success and in June, 2003, at a ceremony in Redmond, CA, my company received the Excellence Award of the Year from Microsoft.</p>

Business Development, Vendor Relationships Management<br>
<br>
Details:<br>
In 1993 Kraft Foods International acquired the plant “Republika” - a national market leader in confectionery production. Kraft’s goal was to establish a brand name and build a solid distribution vendor network. I worked to build relationships with local distribution companies, gain market share, supply market intelligence data and train local sales teams. Due to my dedication and tremendous success I was presented the Above and Beyond the Call of Duty Award at a ceremony in the Kraft Headquarters by Michele Boon, CEO, Kraft Foods International, Eastern Europe.</p>

Details:<br>
In the late 90-s Heineken, through its subsidiary Brewinvest, acquired 98% ownership in Zagorka Brewery, one of the most famous breweries in Eastern Europe. I was trained by Heineken marketing executives to excel in all aspects of Product Management. I managed the promotional activities (media buying, campaigns, ads), brand positioning (market segmentation, focused marketing, image), and product features (labeling, design, quality, taste). I was tracking the effectiveness of my efforts with the help of the local AC Nielsen office (a market research company). I also worked with major advertising and medial buying agencies in the country on producing TV commercials and organizing creative advertising campaigns. My direct reports were my administrative assistant, 2 warehouse managers, and their warehouse support personnel.</p>

Details:<br>
While studying for my Master’s degree in International Business I joined a professional Management Consulting team at my university. The project was managed by my professors and funded by the European Union. Our clients included profitable and growth oriented small and medium businesses, and a few turnaround situations. I provided Business Planning and Financial Management consulting services, as well as ad-hoc consulting in the areas of operations, marketing and information technology.</p>
