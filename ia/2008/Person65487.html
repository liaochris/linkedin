              <p class="summary">
                My passion is Design. The Design of all things. Design is my life and it trancends all mediums. I enjoy doing Flash Design as well as Flash Development. The two are intertwined with stunning visuals and rich engaging interactivity. My drive and passion is to do both and do it well. With a hunger and passion for making things better and more enjoyable, I strive for Excellence. ( Excellence: The quality of excelling; Possessing good qualities in high degree ). <br>
<br>
I have experience designing and maintaining company brands and identities as well as Designing Flash and Developing Flash applications with these company identities. Maintaining a company brand is very important and requires precision and discipline.<br>
<br>
My interest in Flash Development is present as well. My belief is that Design compliments Development in everyway and that they both fall under the Creative category. My drive to excell at Flash Development is something that is growing in nature and feel it is becoming just strong as my Design skills. I have worked with BellSouth and Realtime Gaming Developing Flash Games and Flash Applications as well as many other small companies.<br>
<br>
Frankie Loscavio is a very Creative Human and needs to be challenged creatively on a daily basis. ( Creative: having the ability or power to create; "a creative imagination". Having the ability to solve problems in ways that are unique and expressive. )<br>
<br>
"We become creative when we realize the infinite possibilities within us and when we understand that our function is not merely to exist but to contribute to life, to improve it, and to make it more meaningful to others." - Frederick Mayer

    <p class="description">I have experience designing and building online Flash casino games for Realtime Gaming. These games where very animation intense and required a working knowledge of asset management in an OOP environment. Vector graphic design as well as vector asset optimization played a huge in not only making these games look like their parent Win32 download versions, but also made them smaller in file size so download play and user experience was increased.<br>
<br>
All of the Projects worked on at Realtime Gaming required that I work closely with Project Managers and Client Services in order to get the best game play possible. Usability and Human Factors were always used to help give the users a better experience and I spent quite some time doing Flash Vector Animations that corresponded with Flash development so that these games where not only highly interactive and visually delightful, but binded themselves to code loosely so that there where easily interchangeable and customizable from game to game.</p>
