            <h2>Anne Derryberry&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Serious games - multiplayer online games with a serious learning objective - are being recognized for their power and effectiveness in training and learning.<br>
<br>
I am a Learning Architect for serious games, online learning games, simulations and virtual worlds. I work with learning organizations, game developers, tools developers, and analysts as learning architect, advisor, consultant, and industry observer.<br>
<br>
My fascination as a designer is with group experience and how groups learn in virtual environments, especially through games. The emphasis in that sentence was on "group". "Group" in this context does not mean a collection of people whose individual statistics are aggregated together. "Groups", or cohorts, are a collection of people who are identified in advance and for whom the experience is intended.<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneur, I'm constantly mulling over business models and monetization strategies. In order for serious games to gain wide-spread adoption, commercial developers will need to figure out how to make money in this space. To do that, design and business minds must wrestle with the ever more pressing problem of how to make learning and meaningful play into profitable and sustainable business. As a friend likes to say, "I know there's a pony in here somewhere."<br>
<br>
I decided to blog because there is precious little valuable discussion in these areas. My blog (www.imserious.net) is my contribution to bridging that gap.
