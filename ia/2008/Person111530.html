            <h2>Laurent Gerard&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Educated in Civil Engineer technical field, I started my career in the IT industry in 1997 by workind at SWIFT as a Product Quality Analyst for 3 years.  This has given me the basic foundations required to think about quality all the way along the line of a project.<br>
Since 2000 I left the dark side of Testing and started to evolve in the Data Warehousing and Business intelligence field which is nowadays my domain of expertise for some years.<br>
My added value is to provide a global end-to-end approach overview on large complex DWH projects based on concrete exposure to each single elements of the project chain lifecycle.<br>
If you need a Database, Data Warehouse or Business Intelligence expert, you found the right place.<br>
