Base Technology Group – Integration Technology<br>
Designed, and created the methodology and technology to be used by the Application Development Group and various Services Groups when integrating Legacy and 3rd Party applications with the Enterprise software.  This included data conversion tools, batch and near-real-time interface tools, and real-time integration technology.  These were provided using C and Informix-4GL libraries, utility programs to be used in UNIX Shell scripts, AWK scripts to automate the generation of code, and other kinds of utilities.  Performed research into the use of newer technologies and did proof-of-concept work regarding the use of object-oriented distributed computing environments such as CORBA and COM/DCOM.  Researched the feasibility of transitioning the development of the products from using Informix-4GL to newer languages such as C++, Visual Basic and JAVA.  Built and managed a team of developers.</p>
