            <h2>Joshua Gordon&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                A dispute resolution professional with a strong background in organizational development and training. With a depth of experience in corporate, government, and educational environments, I hold a strong belief that assessment, coaching, and training integrate to form the foundation for successfully putting theory to impactful practice. Emphasis is on creating value in developing more productive negotiations by developing negotiation skills as a core competency. .<br>
<br>
This core competency is an organizational capability.  Organizations that want to achieve sustainable improvements in their negotiations must understand how to align existing organizational processes, structures, and incentives with an approach that can create value while protecting relationships.  Building individual insight and skill is a start, but without larger changes, individual negotiations often return to their organizations find themselves swimming against strong currents, or getting lost among competing priorities and initiatives

    <p class="description">Over the last fifteen years CBI has offered on-site negotiation training for hundreds of agencies, corporations, and non-profit organizations and groups. We’ve worked with organizations across more than 25 countries. Our tailored courses are grounded in careful application of the Mutual Gains Approach, with up-front assessment of the kinds of negotiation challenges each audience is likely to face. We use an ever-growing library of simulations and cases -- and our expertise in writing them -- to directly tackle the negotiation problems at hand.<br>
<br>
Over the years we’ve found training alone is typically not enough to create and maintain real organizational improvement in negotiations. Our approach focuses on providing the coaching and support on the back end of courses, so that gains can be implemented in the form of sensible models, processes and incentives.</p>
