            <h2>Nathalie Raffault&#8217;s Summary</h2>
              <p class="summary">
                Quality and process management specialist with 17 years of polyvalent experience having worked for French and English companies, including a Singaporean and US experience.<br>
As part of the software department within the Motorola organisation, my mission is to guarantee the software products and projects quality assurance. I can take actions like deploying and maintaining tools and process to get the best quality in respect of the SEI SW-CMM and CMMI standards. <br>
At Sendo, I have been taking care of getting the ISO9001: 2000 certification. <br>
In order to improve the product quality, I execute tasks like studying the working methods, establishing and presenting statistics, performing TickIT and QMS audits, doing data analysis, and setting up continuous action plans. I carried out the technical, financial and quality requirements analysis, and negotiated the software tools purchase prices.<br>
Customer oriented attitude, I have experience in following up costumer folders and managing third party companies and suppliers by solving the defects and disputes causes for example.<br>
In a previous experience, I have defined the required actions in respect of the ISO14001: 1996 environmental standard. <br>
My competencies are quite project management oriented as I have experiences in doing gap analysis, managing and defining requirements, analysing and mitigating risks and costs, investigating, negotiating, deploying process and tools, following work progress and doing status reports.
