    <p class="description">I covered several crisis areas in the world as a (freelance) journalist for various Belgian and international media). I began my career in Afghanistan in 1989 during the withdrawal of the Soviet Army, and then covered the Middle East. I covered the wars in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. I covered fighting in all former Yugoslav republics, except Slovenia for the written press, radio and TV. I was based in Sarajevo (BiH) from April 1992 onwards and followed the conflict until its end. During the summer of 1994, I was sent to Algeria, where I covered the unrests for Belgian media and CNN.</p>
