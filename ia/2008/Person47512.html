    <p class="description">About Diabco Life Sciences: <br>
<br>
An Indiana company, Diabco Life Sciences, LLC provides the first all natural nutraceutical that rivals the performance of a pharmaceutical for Type II and Pre-Diabetics - without the side effects. <br>
<br>
Our flagship product is called Diabatrol - "Nature's Prescription for Diabetes" - it has been clinically tested, performance proven, high in dietary fiber, hypoallergenic, contains over 80 antioxidants and our formulation is currently patent-pending.<br>
<br>
The product is offered in a month supply (60 packets) and comes in powdered form. The powder can be mixed with your favorite beverage (milk, juice, water) and is fantastic (my opinion) with a French Vanilla Slim-Fast; our market research also shows that many people enjoy it with their cereal. The natural flavor of the product is a light vanilla and a little nutty.<br>
