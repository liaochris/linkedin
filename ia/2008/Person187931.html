              <p class="summary">
                Today's web & application design requires the coding savviness of a developer coupled together with the aesthetics of a designer, along with the user awareness of a UX & application definition expert. The new hybrid designer.<br>
<br>
I have been fortunate to build a diverse background of experience fusing the skills of development savviness, visual acuity and clear communication, ranging from sales & visual communications, to business & systems analysis, user experience & interface design, web design & development, software development, to strategy & innovation. Most of that experience has been within the internet startup space, as well as a bit in telecommunications. As time evolve, I find myself focusing more on social design & computing, and the human potential it brings us.<br>
<br>
3 things I like:<br>
~[evolutionary] change<br>
~[organizational] democracy<br>
~[free] food<br>
<br>
Have you seen me on TED lately?

    <p class="description">During the Katrina aftermath i activated a housing connection network. We collected information from people who were willing to give up their homes, living spaces, boats, RVs, community centers, and more to the many displaced folks of hurricane Katrina.

We worked hard and had fun. If we worked together, contact me.<br>
