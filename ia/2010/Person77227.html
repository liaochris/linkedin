<br>
Working with partners we have worked with the leaders across various industries as below.<br>

    <p class="description">I tentatively include this as part of my 'present position' as I continue to create and promote publications as a personal hobby &amp; interest.<br>
<br>
To date:<br>
<br>
People close to me can confirm I have been writing poetry and publications since I learnt to write.<br>
<br>
In the 90's my passion was transformed with the 1994 fires that commenced ravaging Sydney and The Royal National Park (The worlds oldest national park after Yellowstone) on my birthday.<br>
<br>
What inspired me was the ability of people to work together - helping each other in times of need. That night I commenced writing my first novel that took me on a journey of knowledge across the planet.<br>
<br>
I learnt how easy it is to publish your own book from international bestselling authors and publishers and started distributing hand made publications that were promoted and sold via some of Australia's leading book retailers and sat alongside some of Australia's leading artists in local galleries.<br>
<br>
All the time my books helped fund community programs - including education of kids.<br>
<br>
Now I continue to encourage book publishing as a fund-raiser...</p>

    <p class="description">When I commenced as publisher of Fast Thinking Magazine after their first issue, they were faced with a problem - Great first issue results with no longevity of revenue or brand development prepared.<br>
<br>
With an existing clientele of about 20 and no marketing budget, I was responsible for building the brand - and revenue<br>
<br>
When I left in 2008, we had accomplished:<br>
<br>
Fast Thinking was recognised as the #1 magazine promoting &quot;How Innovation Works&quot; and was distributed internationally<br>
<br>
Fast Thinking won the prestigious Bell Award as #1 Business to Business magazine and runner up as Magazine of The Year and Magazine Design of The Year.<br>
www.FastThinking.com.au had been launched<br>
Their digital community exceeded 35,000<br>
Print circulation was 25,000 in Australia<br>
Associated publications had been launched including:<br>
Fast Thinking Innovative Household - with major retailer 'Domayne' sponsoring the Launch event<br>
Fast Thinking - ReThinking Innovation - a custom publication for IBM had been launched<br>
Marketing had been developed contra with events like CeBIT which generated significant revenues.<br>
The Fast Thinking Innovation Awards were about to proceed - with revenue in the hundreds of thousands<br>
The Fast Thinking Digital edition was set to be launched.<br>
<br>
I had also contributed to hard cover publications with revenues in the millions<br>
<br>
And we had significant revenue from custom publishing projects I introduced with companies like Telstra.<br>
<br>
As I travelled internationally with my experience at Fast Thinking I received an overview of publishing<br>
<br>
Most inspiring however was how the community I developed provided insights. The calibre of people I met stretched from CEOs to agency account managers and every one of them I consulted and/or interviewed about their thoughts on innovation, leadership, creativity, sales, marketing, staff development, brand and much much more... (much of which remains confidential to date), provided me with an insight into the future of business.</p>

    <p class="description">Lynette Rochford employed me at ACP. It was a bit of a risk for her given that I had no experience in media, however both Lynette and her publisher believed that given I had self-published numerous books, I deserved a go.<br>
<br>
Work commenced with me and one other bloke on a floor of over 40 women. The other bloke was selling Bride to Be and all the others were either working in sales or editorial/publishing on Bride to Be or my publications - The ACP Kids Titles.<br>
<br>
I quickly learnt that kids titles were in a state of disarray. Pacific Publications had been publishing Disney Adventures and soon as they learnt they were losing the license to ACP, they basically ran it into the ground in preparation for launch of KZONE.<br>
<br>
With next to no forward revenue booked, I had no other option than to get creative and make loads of contacts.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing was that no-one knew much about the kids market at the time. The term 'Tweens' had only just started and their influence on the weekly family investment bill was becoming more regularly publicised.<br>
<br>
What developed was:<br>
Initially increasing advertising rates - when competitors were highly discounting theirs - based on Disney family values<br>
Researching our readers - and kids love to provide feedback<br>
I launched a enews to all the contacts I had been making - starting at CEO level for all the major businesses interested in promoting to kids<br>
Then started the cross-sell. There was no way we could compete with the circulation numbers reported by PacPubs. However when I added publications to proposals like:<br>
Mothers: Womens Weekly/Day, Take 5<br>
Teens: Dolly etc<br>
Digital: ninemsn/disney<br>
Events and entertainment characters<br>
Marketing and sampling, etc<br>
Our footprint expanded for every client<br>
<br>
Throughout my time at ACP, I was an anomaly - unlike everyone who reported to the sales hierarchy, my team communicated with editorial and publishing. The results lead to the launch of new publications and $millions in revenue...</p>

    <p class="description">In early 2007 my cousin Tomas came to me with a scenario requiring a solution.<br>
<br>
A friend of his was establishing a new Pizza joint in Caringbah and needed something special.<br>
<br>
We had an initial meeting and after some brainstorming, decided to look for some graffiti artists to decorate his wall.<br>
<br>
YouthbyDesign was born.<br>
<br>
The wall ended up being decorated by a highly experienced airbrush artist we met - though the journey in finding that artist led to:<br>
<br>
Removable graffiti art displayed throughout the shire<br>
Discovery of a network of over 300 creative aerosol artists<br>
Discovery of over 200 artists from many artistic fields<br>
One of the first companies providing contractual employment and promotion of youth artistic work through local and national media<br>
The first aerosol and airbrush Tafe program and some of the first local community and government funding training programs for aerosol artists<br>
Many community and business funded aerosol designs that still exist today.<br>
<br>
What an inspirational time this was - the youth provided the inspiration and the community encouraged it.<br>
<br>
I remember arguing with John Laws about the only way to manage graffiti, was to make it compulsory - then pay those who were successful at it.<br>
<br>
There were many successes - like front window displays on Oxford street, Window displays with manikin heads for Sceats comp, Artists works rotated within restaurants for sale, Walls of remembrance at PCYC locations, YBDevious days sponsored by Pepsi, Nando's and many others...<br>
<br>
so much fun... and the young ones benefitted...</p>

    <p class="description">Have you ever wished to learn more about the industry of 'Art &amp; Memorabilia'?<br>
<br>
Through my experience with YouthbyDesign, my interest in this area was developed significantly.<br>
<br>
After spending a week working with my cousin Tomas on the bell tower overlooking the SCG at Fox Studios (One of the places I re-inforced my fear of heights - stepping out 10 stories up onto a skimpy scaffold with sheeting 3mtrs long and 5foot high flexing in the wind that promoted FOX) - I finished with an interview with the MD at Larson Juhl and took the job.<br>
<br>
What a interesting time<br>
<br>
I was taken through the archives and background tunnels of some of Australia's leading art galleries, museums, conservation centres and picture framing galleries - gathering knowledge on international and local history that covered centuries of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Everything from mass production of your footy memorabilia in your cellar to high brow artists works that never see the light of day.<br>
<br>
I sold the framing materials and machinery that are internationally regarded as the best in the world, whilst also having in the back of my mind that many of the framing materials were using high quality timber from ever depleting forests across the planet.<br>
<br>
I comforted those thoughts with the knowledge that as I travelled between picture framers, they provided me with the cut-outs of their mat boards and off cuts of their framing that helped me produce the hand made publications that I later sold through galleries and book retailers to help raise money for various charitable projects.<br>
<br>
It really is a funny world we live in, and the conservation of our history I found through this work and see in peoples memories framed in every home I visit never ceases to remind me of that.</p>

    <p class="description">Jono Hennessy Sceats remains a close friend and mentor of mine.<br>
<br>
I recall many years ago discussing with Jono how people should be managed.<br>
<br>
He replied, I want to find out what you want to do and help you do it!<br>
<br>
Throughout my career, Jono, Wendy Moore who was editor (and managed kids publications at ACP and is now editor of Home Beautiful) and Lynette Rochford remain three of the most influential people I have had the benefit of learning from in my career and believe in that motto.<br>
<br>
Many of you may not know that Jono was the designer of Australia's #1 best selling optical and sunglass frames for many years.<br>
<br>
He was also voted Australia's most eligible bachelor a few+ years ago.<br>
<br>
I joined Jono when they were in a rut and managed sales through 7 years that included 4 management buyouts.<br>
<br>
Despite the arguing at the top that included there initially being two Jonathan Sceats brands competitng with each other and ending with Jono having to sell his name as a brand, we still managed to sell $millions and re-develop relationships with retailers like OPSM, Sunglass Hut, David Jones and many more<br>
<br>
Jono remains one of my closest business contacts and is still surprised to this date how a person with an approach that is as relaxed as myself, continued to be his best sales person, whilst leading and managing a team of sales people interested in Australian design and fashion.<br>
<br>
I still love Jono's idea of bringing 100 designers to Australia to help improve creativity on Australian executive boards - whilst providing opportunity to promote Australia to the world.<br>
<br>
If any of you have suggestions - let's talk.<br>
<br>
Jono now has his new brand using his middle name:<br>

    <p class="description">I was 22 and had been selling IBM equipment to CEOs and their staff, predominantly in the Sydney CBD for a while when I met a consultant at lunch who recommended the Financial industry as my future.<br>
<br>
Given my Grandfather had been very successful in the field in the UK, I thought it was worth a look.<br>
<br>
Looking back, in your early twenties, you can be 'rather impressionable', as my first day at work was a trip on Sydney harbour, all expenses paid with people from across the globe bragging about their success making hundreds of thousands, despite the recession<br>
<br>
I joined and within a few months was recognised as #1 in sales. Not because I had a large network as most who had joined with success with family contacts etc, purely through referrals.<br>
<br>
Given my success, I was responsible for sales and business development training of over 150 sales executives.<br>
<br>
Referred to as the 'referal king' I continued as #1 in sales till I discovered that there were more interesting things in life for a person at that age and entered the world of fashion...</p>

    <p class="description">My Dad is a builder. He was fortunate enough to be educated by the leading builders in UK befor coming to OZ<br>
<br>
Together with a team of Danish and other guys (my Mum's Danish) they built Goldfields House - Sydney's first highrise - The Roundhouse at UNSW - where I studied, Grosvenor Place, where I worked with AMP and many more before he built many residential houses, including the one - where I grew up and now own.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I discovered many years later how Dad helped me get my first 'job'. I was selling and delivering building materials throughout school and uni and that job let me travel overseas for a year (with a bit of overseas work experience)<br>
<br>
Lynns gave me that benefit through a part time wage and all the skills in selling at retail - whilst learning the books - and I will be forever grateful...<br>
<br>
One disadvantage that prevented me entering the building industry - my hands - constantly pealing given an allergic reatcion to timber sap for the years I worked there</p>
