  </p>
    <p class="description">Provided engineering support for the new ALP-46A electric locomotives for NJ Transit.  The ALP-46A locomotives are based on the original ALP-46 locomotives built by Bombardier Transportation in 2001.  The significant change from the first series is the new propulsion system which has been changed from GTO to IGBT inverters.  The new converter modules also require new vehicle control software.  The changes from the first series are new to NJ Transit, but many of the changes been used in service on the TRAXX platform locomotives used all over Europe.<br>
<br>
Engineering support included testing at Bombardier's manufacturing facility in Kassel, Germany (9/2009 to 12/2009) and testing at TTCI in Pueblo, Colorado and Kearny, New Jersey (1/2010 - present).</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Provided installation, technical support, and design solutions for compatibility testing for Mafersa push-pull cars for Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT).  CDOT procured 33 push-pull cars from Virginia Railway Express that needed to be modified to work on the Connecticut infrastucture.  Subsystems operated from different voltages (32VDC, 64VDC, 120VAC, 230VAC) and modification to the power distribution was required.  Work included specifying and changing out contactors and protection devices as well as modifying general arrangements and corresponding drawings.<br>
<br>
Connecticut also required the addition of the Advanced Civil Speed Enforement System (ACSES), which is the train control system used on the Northeast-Corridor (NEC).  ACSES equipment needed to be installed underneath the car and inside the equipment lockers.  All new equipment required conformance to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations found in 49 CFR 238.<br>
<br>
Due to the drastic difference in environmental conditions from Virginia to Connecticut, snow ingestion problems led to significant failures of the 480VAC to 74VDC low voltage power supply (LVPS) and battery charger (BC).  The failure mode identified was failure of the transformer insulation, which caused 480VAC to flash over to the secondary side of the transformer.  As a result, all cars experienced multiple failures of subsystem power supplies (wheel-slde, communications, lighting, and cab control circuits).  A crowbar circuit was designed to apply a short circuit across the output of the LVPS and BC units when the voltage exceeded 95VDC.  Careful consideration was taken to only fire the SCR in the crowbar during a true failure and not during the normal operation of the car battery voltage range (50-90VDC).  The long term solution was to redesign the LVPS and BC systems.  Power consumption and protection were re-evaluated.  Currently the design review is complete and the units are entering production.</p>

    <p class="description">Provided engineering support for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) Silverline V electric multiple units (EMU) procurement.  Engineering support included design review for the propulsion system, braking system, lighting system, communications system, low-voltage power supply, diagnostic system, integrated schematics, and Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA).  The existing fleet is over 40 years old and train interoperability, maintainability, and training are new to all parties involved.  Other challenges included technology obsolescence from the time of specification development and contract award.  Multiple specification change and approval requests were reviewed.  In some cases, the car builder proposed alternative solutions to address shortcomings and the alternatives were approved based on the intent of the technical specification.<br>
<br>
Engineering support included testing at UTS manufacturing facility in Changwon, South Korea (July 2009 - present).  I was the resident test engineer from July thru September.  From September on, I managed the team of engineers who continued testing in Changwon thru December.  The cars will ship from South Korea to Philadelphia, PA and testing will resume in Philadelphia in January 2010.</p>

    <p class="description">Provided design review and verification testing for the communications system equipment for Metro-North Railroad.  The M-8 vehicles are electric multiple units capable of running from overhead catenary, single phase AC power and third rail DC power.  The communications system is a safety critical system which requires power from the 64VDC car battery for emergency operation.  The system consists of a Communications Control Unit (CCU), Communications Control Panel (CCP), Passenger Emergency Intercom (PEI), and various LED message signs and speakers.  Challenges faced during this procurement include operational interoperability with the existing fleet of M-7 vehicles, maintainability between the two fleets (use of common parts, form and fit constraints) and technology obsolescence.<br>
<br>
Reviewed drawing submittals and change orders, conformance with the specification requirements during final design, and inspected environmental temperature qualification testing and electromagnetic interference testing in various areas of Montreal, QC</p>

    <p class="description">Provided engineering support for all electrical modifications to eight NJ Transit multi-level cars for the fitting of food and beverage equipment as part of a 3-year trial of the Atlantic City Express Service (ACES) to Atlantic City, NJ, from New York City. The modifications include additional 480VAC and 120VAC power reticulation to the on-board food service kiosk, together with the fitting and coordination of added protective devices.<br>
<br>
The main design constrain on this project was the ability to revert all modifications to the original configuration.  All modifications are bolt-ons with careful attention to preserving original base car reliability and maintainability.  To meet Federal Railroad Administration requirements, all modifications required structural analysis in all three-axis.  Multiple equipment arrangements were mocked up because of insufficient strength in the car under frame members to withstand the maximum stresses.  To meet NJ Transit requirements, all modifications required functional verification for all operating conditions (diesel locomotive power, electric locomotive power, shop power, and layover track power) as well as maintainability demonstrations.  Due to the power limits of the existing car 120VAC transformer, the cars were fitted with auxiliary transformers to operate coffee machines, multiple refrigerators, microwaves, and LCD monitor and DVD equipment.  Equipment wiring was carefully routed to use existing cable trays and minimize car body interior paneling.</p>

Validation and qualification testing included the brake system (dry and wet braking performance, response time, thermal endurance testing), locomotive control trainlines, door and communication control trainlines, low-voltage power supply (LVPS), communications system, monitoring and diagnostic system, ride quality, door system, and HVAC under all loading conditions (AW0 &#x2013; empty car, AW2 &#x2013; all seats occupied, and AW3 &#x2013; crush load ~52,000 lbs passenger loading).  Lighting, communications, and monitoring and diagnostic design reviews and qualification testing inspections were held in Plattsburgh, NY and Montreal, QC.<br>
<br>
After testing was completed at TTCI, additional testing activities continued when the cars were delivered onto NJ Transit property.  Additional subsystem testing included automatic train control (ATC), cab signal, simulated revenue service, passenger information system, and remote diagnostics.<br>
<br>
During testing and revenue service, focus shifted to reliability engineering.  Field modifications were reviewed and tested on control cars in revenue service.  Validation of the modification effectiveness required approval prior to cutting-into production of the remaining cars at the car builder manufacturing facility.</p>

    <p class="description">Provided design review and verification testing for the lighting and communications system equipment for Virginia Railway Express (VRE).  The vehicle is based on the Chicago METRA gallery cars, with changes in the lighting and communication system for reliability reasons.  Lighting system design was reviewed and went through two design reviews.  The first used a single inverter to convert 32VDC to 120AC to provide power for the fluorescent ballasts.  The first proposal was disapproved based on the reliability information calculated during the Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA).  The single point failure was not reliable enough for a safety critical system like emergency lighting.  The second proposal used 32VDC inverter ballasts instead of 120VAC ballasts.  The communications system was a completely new design with a new equipment supplier.  VRE also did not have an automated passenger information system on their previous equipment.  Typically GPS is used to identify vehicle location on the system, but with all of the tunnels in the infrastructure a GPS signal cannot be used alone.  The alternative to GPS was to use a distance counting method.  Multiple measurements were taken between each station on the Manassas Line and Fredericksburg Line.  Once a train route has been entered by the crew, the system will synchronize each stop and count the distance traveled from the speed sensors installed on each axle.  Multiple trigger points were used to coordinate the automatic announcements, door opening/closing signals, and additional passenger information.  Verification testing required design review meetings in Montreal, QC and Washington, DC to identify shortcomings (mainly system integration between the door system, communications system, and monitoring system) and design field modifications to correct these integration issues.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Tested Comet II and Comet V cars to determine the cause of 10A circuit breaker trips on the fleet. Cab and trailer cars were outfitted with data recorders to monitor power quality of the low-voltage power supplies (LVPS) for static and dynamic testing.  Circuit breaker sizing and timing curves were reviewed.  When Comet II and Comet V coaches were coupled together, there were reports that all LVPS circuit breakers were tripped.  The Comet II LVPS was a constant voltage charger with a current limit of 90A.  Between 80-90A, the current tapered down to control the power consumption.  The Comet V was a constant current type charger with two distinct outputs (car load and car battery).  The current limit to the battery of 20A.  During the winter season, the corresponding LVPS output voltage to provide a dead battery 20A was very low relative to the Comet II cars.  This caused a car load imbalance due to the car battery trainline and the higher voltage on adjacent cars.  The Comet II cars provided power to the Comet V car loads, which caused the 10A circuit breakers to trip.  Once the Comet II circuit breakers tripped, the Comet V LVPS units would supply the car loads to the Comet II cars (Comet II LVPS is now offline) until the circuit breakers tripped.  Two actions were required to remedy the problem.  The Comet II and Comet V circuit breakers were changed out from 10A to 15A.  The 10A circuit breakers tripped because the main 480VAC power supply from the locomotive is an inverter-based supply and the harmonic distortion (&lt;5%) was enough to raise the current on one line to the point of tripping.  The Comet V LVPS units required a software modification to raise the battery charging current from 20A to 50A to raise the cold-start voltage output to reduce the car load sharing between the two vehicle types.</p>
