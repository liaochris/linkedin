  </p>
    <p class="description">I manage the Marketing Department, which consists of a Copywriter, two Designers, a Database Manager and a Web Manager. Under my leadership, the Department is responsible for the production of all marketing collateral, all direct marketing, advertising, onlinemarketing, the development/maintenance and optimisation of the Access web site, and the management and maintenance of the Access prospect and customer database. <br>
<br>
As well as managing the Marketing Team and delivering all marketing activity for Access, I was also responsible for driving and implementing the new Access UK brand and delivering it in a tight timeframe, utilising resources solely from within my Team, without the assistance of any external agencies. <br>
<br>
The adoption of a single brand, across the 5 different companies dictated the creation of new marketing collateral, campaigns and signage, as well as the development of a new web site. I delivered the new brand (in all applications) both on time and to budget. <br>
<br>
I am now the Access Brand Manager, responsible for policing it and ensuring that every employee adheres strictly to brand book and responsible for championing the new brand promise/brand values, ensuring our new tone of voice reflects these and is portrayed in all of our marketing communication to our different audiences. <br>
<br>
I am also responsible for the production and management of the company marketing plan and help set, and part-own, the marketing budget, ensuring all types of marketing activity is delivered within the agreed budgets. <br>
<br>
I work closely with the Access PR Manager, ensuring that campaigns and other marketing activity are fully joined-up with the company&#x2019;s PR activity and that we are sending out consistent messaging at all times. <br>
<br>
We also jointly own Access&#x2019; social networking strategy which includes; Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn page, producing podcasts and the enhancement of the Access blog.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">City-based Asyst had grown dramatically as a company and identified a need for their own Marketing Manager to drive the company&#x2019;s marketing activity (as part of the Access Group, Asyst had previously relied on Access Accounting&#x2019;s Marketing Team to manage the organisation&#x2019;s marketing and the company was not given the focus or support required to move the business forward).<br>
<br>
This was an excellent opportunity for me to move within the Access Group and, once again, initiate a new marketing function within an organisation, create a marketing plan and negotiate and manage a marketing budget.<br>
<br>
I was in charge of all marketing activity, from the creation and deployment of campaigns (both printed direct mail and email), to the production of marketing collateral (stationery, brochures and case studies). I was also responsible for the organisation of prospect seminars, customer user days and larger scale trade shows and events. Part of my role also involved liaising with the Access Group PR Manager to ensure Asyst was fully represented in the media.<br>
<br>
I was appointed Marketing Manager at the head office and given more responsibility, a Creative Team to manage and an exciting new branding project to own.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">I was originally employed as Vertical Campaign Marketing Manager, a new role that was specifically created for me. I accepted the position because I knew it would give me the opportunity to concentrate purely on producing campaigns and provide me with the valuable experience of being part of a very large Marketing Team. I was given free reign to utilise the skills of my marketing colleagues and thus manage and work with them to complete campaign projects.<br>
<br>
Each campaign I worked on utilised all elements of the marketing mix; printed direct mail, supporting email campaigns, newswires, advertising in the trade press, PR, specific web pages; as well as producing all supporting and follow-up material for each campaign, such as specific product literature.<br>
<br>
I was responsible for the entire campaign from design concept to deployment, ensuring that it was produced to schedule and within budget. I was measured on campaign results, and therefore made certain that the in-house telemarketing team was fully briefed so that each campaign was followed-up with aggressive telemarketing activity.<br>
<br>
Role responsibility included the measurement of each campaign, reviewing the number of responses and leads generated from each, the total cost of each campaign, cost per lead and the overall return on investment.<br>
<br>
After 6 months, I was promoted to Campaign Manager, another new position that was specifically created for me. Access was keen that I emulated the success that I had achieved with vertical campaigns and extend this to larger horizontal campaigns. I managed the marketing campaign plan and schedule and owned the annual campaign spend, ensuring that campaigns were deployed on time and to budget.<br>
<br>
As Campaign Manager, I juggled an extremely busy campaign calendar, increased the response rates and a particular highlight was achieving the most successful campaign in Access history, which generated thousands of enquiries and leads, and a number of high value sales.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Getech had experienced dramatic growth, which led to the new appointment of a Marketing Manager to develop and deliver a marketing plan, manage the marketing spend and undertake the challenge of building a new department from scratch.<br>
<br>
Initially, the budget did not allow for a marketing team so, in order to implement the marketing plan, I became Getech&#x2019;s &#x2018;one-person marketing department&#x2019;; responsible for all the marketing activity; advertising, production of marketing collateral, corporate events, PR etc, without the need for external agencies.<br>
<br>
One of my initial marketing projects was to &#x2018;refresh&#x2019; the existing Getech brand. I developed this myself in-house, again, without the use of an external agency. All existing marketing collateral and livery was replaced with the updated Getech brand. <br>
<br>
A new brand in place, my next strategic marketing initiative was to implement a schedule of DM campaigns, both to the end user and reseller audience. This consisted of both print and electronic campaigns.<br>
<br>
Eventually, with budget made available, I built a small Marketing Team to support the expanding campaign activity; a Database Manager and 3 Telemarketers to follow-up each campaign. All messaging, concept, targeting and campaign production was handled in-house, by myself, as well as the production of all printed supporting campaign material and the development of micro websites.<br>
<br>
I was responsible for providing the Database Manager with a full data brief and also managed the purchasing of any new data. It was also part of my role to fully brief the Telemarketers and work with them to develop &#x2018;scripts&#x2019; and ensure they hit their daily call targets.<br>
<br>
Getech attended a number of trade shows throughout the year and I was tasked with booking and co-ordinating these events.</p>

    <p class="description">Office Team was a dynamic city-based marketing company operating at a faster pace and with stricter deadlines than I had experienced in my earlier positions. Office Team also had a much larger budget to spend on marketing design, printing and PR.<br>
<br>
My main responsibility was to provide Resellers of the Office Team portfolio with marketing campaigns and collateral to enable them to sell Office Team product, in the form of advertisements, brochures, direct mail and catalogues; while ensuring that the brand and corporate guidelines were closely adhered to on each project.</p>
