  </p>
    <p class="description">Nobia AB, a kitchen company, engages in the development, manufacture, and marketing of interior solutions for kitchens, bathrooms, and storage operations. <br>
<br>
I joined Hygena, the French arm of Nobia to take on a hybrid post as Programme Manager and PMO Consultant with the aim to rapidly implement a Programme Management approach to improve control and visibility to a huge transformation and change management initiative and develop internal resources to enable them to contribute to the 13 workstreams in the Programme.<br>
<br>
My initial responsibility is to implement governance to integrate and control the workstreams underpinned by the SAP technology initiative, process reengineering, change management and the redesign of the supply chain mechanism, whilst coordinating the associated purchasing, procurement, warehouse management, reporting and marketing and sales teams also contributing to the transformation of the business. <br>
<br>
Working directly with the Programme Sponsors and sitting on the Programme Board and Steering Committee, I am directly responsible for the implementation of the programme structure, roles and responsibilities, the integrated programme plan, the setting up of the PMO, the risk, issues and assumption logs, the benefits plan, cost and resource schedule and the change control mechanism.</p>

 &mdash; <abbr class="dtend" title="2010-01-01">January 2010</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P7M">(7 months)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">My first task for ResMed was to bring together an incoherent &#x201c;list&#x201d; of projects and form a balanced and concise portfolio, ensuring that business critical projects were prioritised, had a sound business case and cost-benefit analysis and were fully resourced with risks and issues and dependencies clearly documented. I was required to produce a Portfolio &#x201c;Dashboard&#x201d; to support this initiative.<br>
<br>
My second task was to run projects through the full project lifecycle or to intervene in business critical projects that were not being delivered to business as required. <br>
<br>
My third task regarded the establishment of a Portfolio, Programme and Project Office Management (P30) model, to enable ResMed IT to assist senior management&#x2019;s decision making on prioritisation, risk management and deployment of resources across the organisation to successfully deliver to their business objectives. This initiative was also intended to identify and realise outcomes and benefits via programmes and projects and ensure the delivery of these within time, cost, quality and organisational constraints. The above model provided the focal point for defining a balanced portfolio of change and ensuring consistent delivery of programmes and projects (10+ for which I was ultimately responsible) across European IT.<br>
<br>
I was also tasked with improving the current Project Management Office (PMO) by developing the centre of excellence, an in-house Project Management Methodology and coaching and mentoring teams in the discipline. I was also required to introduce project governance and ensuring that best practise techniques were utilised rigorously. This required the constant monitoring of projects&#x2019; performance and report consolidation to provide key information to a wide audience. I also conducted regular project reviews (50+ projects) and health checks, facilitated workshops, onboarded additional resources and provided Project and Programme Management Support where needed.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">The International Financial Services arm (Clerical Medical and Heidelberger Leben) of Lloyds Banking Group is one of the foremost cross-border life and pensions and capital investment businesses in Europe.<br>
<br>
Following the successful acquisition of HBOS, IFS has launched several projects dealing with multiple benefits. I manage two projects, both which have critical timelines as they are regulatory projects commissioned by the German Tax Authorities (ZfA) in order to improve communication flows with Lloyds and the reporting of pension annuity payments throughout Europe.<br>
<br>
I manage a budget of $2m and a team of 20 staff, from Customer Service Personnel, System Analysts, Requirement Engineers, and IT Project Managers and communicate with Senior Project Sponsors right through to the board.<br>
<br>
A restructuring of the Business Change Delivery Department from an unstructured, undocumented environment to a full process orientated environment adds a large degree of complexity to the projects. This, coupled with a resistance to change requires strong interpersonal and people skills and a project manager able to speak the local language (I was based out of Heidelberg with frequent travel to Luxembourg and Maastricht).<br>
<br>
The new governance based on Lloyds Project Methodology and tool (Change Management Approach &#x2013; CMA &amp; CMT) requires the project manager to own the Business Case, Change Requests and Impact Analysis as well as the full development schedule based on Agile. Additional responsibilities are the Vendor Management of the third party suppliers (FJA &amp; SOKA-IT), full monthly forecasts and accruals, risk, issue and assumption management, release management and the control of the multiple cross portfolio dependencies.</p>

<br>
For strategic reasons, BFBP decided to launch a restructuring of the architecture of the risk platform. The evolution of the risk platform involves the migration of the risk domain (Basel II plus ten other credit risk applications) to a new technical environment (from Natixis to BFBP). My mission as Programme Manager was to guide the functional and technical migration of ten applications, ensuring continuity of service for users, managing 10 Projects and Project Managers and a budget of $10 million.<br>
<br>
As Programme Manager, I was required to manage the migration of all risk domain applications from the source to target platform, produce a detailed programme plan and put together the team structure for the migration. Along with the development teams, I was responsible for the implementation of the new target and the definition of the SLAs with the various subcontractors.<br>
<br>
I was also tasked with the steering of the ten projects with both internal and external parties and managing the communication both upwards and outwards.  I held a budget of $10 and was required to manage this meticulously. Additional tasks which I was required to perform were Risk and Issue Management, Change Control, Programme tracking, Programme Planning, direction of the various PMOs, and the occasional coaching of the Project Managers based on Programme processes and methodology. I reported directly into the BFBP Programme Board and the Head of Risk.</p>
