    <h2>Allen Wyke&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        Turnaround or critical launch technologist available for onsite work in New York City area, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Washington DC, Boston and Charlotte.<br>
<br>
Since 1995 I have worked for Internet technology companies. Unlike many technology executives making the leap from Enterprise to online, my entire career has been in the interactive Web space making it easy for me to assess situations, plan and execute. Generally brought in for quick movement: turn around, rebuild, transition, or startup. But not just a technologist - applying technology to drive business and revenue is what excites me.<br>
<br>
Worked for software and media companies to build and run development, QA, documentation, technical support, professional services, project and product management, and information systems teams. Worked with or for Microsoft, Lycos, c|net, Ask, McAfee, Sony Online, Modiv Media, Zumobi, Ringleader Digital, Global Grind, Hearst, RadarOnline, and approximately 100 others.<br>
<br>
Experience includes mergers and acquisitions, mobile advertising, online/interactive media, content management systems, open source and commercial software, Web/Internet standards, online communities, SEO, and nimble ways to execute with immediate impact - most times well under budget. Very hands on in defining and driving product and technology strategies and execution.<br>
<br>
Standards participation include co-founding and initially chairing the Emergency Management Technical Committee at OASIS, participating on P3P Working Group at W3C and CPExchange at IDEAlliance, and working on early online advertising standards effort (adXML). Written over a dozen books, numerous articles, and a training video on standards, Internet technologies, and programming languages such as XML, PHP, JavaScript, .NET, and Perl. Most recent authoring is on open source CMS and using Mac OS X for small/home office.<br>
<br>
Often brought in by a CEO or COO and available as a consultant or a full time position if the circumstances are right.

    <p class="description">Direct Brands, Inc. is the largest direct-to-consumer distributor of media products in the U.S. The company is home to such market-leading music, DVD and book club brands as BMG Music Service, Columbia House, DoubleDay Book Club, Book-of-the-Month Club, as well as a number of special interest and lifestyle book clubs. The company serves millions of members in the U.S. and Canada through its various club catalogs and online.<br>
<br>
I was originally brought into Direct Brands as a consultant to help onboard the new CEO. At that time, the company did not have a CTO and had very little, if any, digital expertise. Over the course of a few months, the role of auditing the company's technology and digital products (websites) and outlining a recommendation and plan to realign with the aggressive corporate goals, I joined the organization. I assumed accountability for technology strategy (Architects) as well as the enhancement of our digital environment (CTO role), our existing web sites (Product Management), new product development and digital products such as e-books and digital downloads (CDO role). As part of the Executive team at Direct Brands, I work closely with senior management and all other departments of the company to bring best practices in digital strategy and execution.</p>

    <p class="description">Rockstar Games pushed boundaries with its Grand Theft Auto franchise. Two of the co-founders, together with a couple of industry vets, formed 4mm Games to reinvent the rollout of new titles using the Web.<br>
<br>
Brought in originally by their CEO on to architect and plan their first online community platform, which will be tied to the upcoming title, Def Jam Rapstar. Since then, I have been responsible for all of the digital/online efforts, including standing up a development team, handling budgeting, working to layout a Product and SEO Strategy, and defining the Product Roadmap, as well as starting the initial efforts around the Revenue Model.<br>
<br>
While on the surface, www.defjamrapstar.com exhibits what you would expect in any online community, the undercurrent drives it to be a persona promotional platform/machine. The intent for the content and capabilities here to stimulate aspirational emotions, and then leverage/harness that power to ground swell the consumer base to grow the brand and franchises ability to sustain itself.<br>
<br>
The essence of the effort can be thought of as where Guitar Hero/Rock Band meet American Idol, except to experience this in the digital space...a platform allowing people to promote themselves, archive fame, popularity and celebrity status all while walking the fine line of providing them a clear path to work toward, without explicitly defining it. We do this because we need to be able to handle solid and gift talent, but also instant celebrities, such as those seen in the &quot;William Hung or Susan Boyle Effects&quot; if you will.</p>

    <p class="description">Savory was born when the Founders, like many people, found themselves disappointed that popular restaurant guides were more like a phone book than a trusted source. Or user reviews seemed written by a chef's mother or fired line cook. In April of 2006 the first site, Savory New York, launched with the idea that a combination of in-depth restaurant information, hand-aggregated critical reviews, recommendations from top chefs and documentary-style video profiles of notable restaurants would go a long way toward helping people make better decisions about where to dine out. Since then more cities have launched and the small organization is well on its way to becoming a trusted source of restaurant information online. <br>
<br>
At Savory I advised on technology and product development strategy, as well as guide technical execution where needed. I can't say enough good things about what is going on here - stay tuned and feel free to reach out to me if you want to know more or how to get involved.</p>
