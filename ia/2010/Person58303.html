An achiever who enjoys accepting responsibility for assignments, thriving in fast-paced ever-changing client environments.  By hiring a contract recruiter a high-tech company which had three building with a three shift operations wanted to hire 200 new employees.

Develop pricing strategies with the goal of maximizing the firm's profits or share of the market while ensuring the firm's customers are satisfied.  Oversee product development or monitor trends that indicate the need for new products and services.  Responsible for strategic business development.<br>
<br>
Identified a market for half-day professional development seminars and support services that enabled a local education and training company to survive two economic downturns. Developed a series of promotional events that brought new customers into the sales funnel which resulted in a 200% increase of repeat business. Managed new product and services development initiatives, monitored trends to help stay competitive. Planned events on and off-site, while demonstrating problem solving and interpersonal communications skills. Effectively managed multiple priorities while maintaining high levels of accountability and attention to detail while monitoring business referrals and feedback from participants. <br>
<br>
Additional seminars were eventually added in communications, risk management,  team building, negotiations, and conflict management to the already offered PM training and PMP certification programs.  Identify, develop, and evaluated the marketing strategy, based on knowledge of establishment objectives, market characteristics, and cost and markup factors.  Compile lists describing product or service offerings.  The seminars were also tailored per the client&#x2019;s requirements.  We were also able to bundle the seminars with consulting services.  Seminars were usually held on the client&#x2018;s site so they were convenient for all employees.  If the company held a week long &#x201c;boot camp&#x201d; for the executives and their teams then an offsite location was selected.</p>

    <p class="description">As the VP of Communications for the Dallas PMI Board I had the privilege of reaching out to all members by helping them stay informed with the current month&#x2019;s activities.  This privilege extended to writing the history for the Dallas PMI Chapter about all the activities that  was happening in the Dallas PMI chapter.  I published the Dallas Chapters newsletter which was at that time stilled mailed out monthly.  Some of the information included who received their PMP and what company&#x2019;s had Company Coordinators and who the monthly Speaker was and what the Dinner included.  We finally published the Newsletter and directory on-line which was a great &#x201c;cost saving measure&#x201d; for the Dallas Chapter of PMI.<br>
<br>
When first introduced to the Dallas Chapter of PMI in 1990 the Dallas Chapter of PMI barely had 100 members.  Upon joining the PMI Dallas Board in 1999 we had 700 members and when I left the Dallas PMI Board in 2004 we had over 2500 members.  The entire Board of the Dallas Chapter of PMI had only Seven Board Members the entire time I was an active Board member.  We even continued growing through the 911 disaster.  <br>
<br>
We also implemented a Dallas PMP Certification One Day Training Program at a very low cost to our members. This was a huge success and a great value to the PMI Dallas members.  The update to the PMI Dallas Chapter website was another awesome benefit to the member&#x2019;s allowing the membership &#x201c;real time&#x201d; information especially the activities for the PMP certification classes and the &quot;Job Openings&quot; that were posted by the local Dallas area companies.  This helped our members enormously.<br>
<br>
Finally, I was honored by the Dallas Chapter as Chapter Member of the Year in 2003 for improving the PMI Dallas Chapter&#x2019;s Communications.  My years with the Dallas PMI Board have many fond memories and I am so grateful that I could be of service to the Dallas Chapter PMI members.</p>

Fascinating stats indicates that when males retire ages 50 to 70, and do not have a hobby or some form of involvement; most likely they will die within two years.  This was recently confirmed by a study that Northrop Grumman did on their retiring males. Other benefits for companies who make an effort to employ all ages of employees is to create a mentoring and home like environment which boosts morale and productivity.</dd>
