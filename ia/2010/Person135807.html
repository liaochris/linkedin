    <h2>Marty Taylor&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        President and CEO of  Wireless Resolutions, a highly successful and much sought after Wireless Expense Management company and Customer Advocate group, that specializes in helping business owners dramatically reduce their cell phone costs.<br>
<br>
 After 20 years of working in the wireless industry and  being told frequently that I was too forthright and honest with my accounts, I decided to stop working for the wireless providers and start working directly for the customer. <br>
<br>
Over 66% of all cell phone bills have errors and over 80% of business owners pay them anyway without knowing. Last year the wireless providers brought in an additional $60 million dollars from overcharging their customers. <br>
<br>
Having worked with all the major providers and knowing how the system works, I have developed the expert negotiation skills needed to get our clients the lowest possible cost for the very best service their carrier has to offer.  My staff is made up of some of the best wireless experts in the nation.  We focus on helping businesses who are overwhelmed with the high cost of wireless communications and do not have the in-house expertise it takes to manage their wireless accounts.<br>
<br>
Our company has shown phenominal growth.  We currently manage wireless expenses for over 700 companies nationwide.  Our goal is to reach as many businesses as possible to help them lower their wireless costs.
      </p>
    
    
      <h3>Marty Taylor&#8217;s Specialties:</h3>
      <p class="skills">
        We specialize in contract negotiations, dramatically reducing wireless bills, eliminating phones not being used, replacing old phones at little or no cost, and managing accounts for continued savings. We excel in Wireless Expense management through bill auditing and cost validation and by discovering billing errors and overcharges.
