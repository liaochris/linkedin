    <h2>Jeff Putnam&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        As the founder of Freedom by Design, Inc. &amp; www.MindScanPro.com, I am a seasoned executive leadership coach with more than a decade of experience specializing in one-on-one remote coaching for C-Suite level professionals.<br>
<br>
Having coached hundreds of executives, entrepreneurs, sales &amp; other professionals over many years, I&#x2019;ve developed dozens of methods for cutting through to the core of any issue.  I provide my clients with an unbiased, direct &amp; insightful perspective which brings out the very best in their ability to lead themselves and others to greater success.  <br>
<br>
In today&#x2019;s hurried business climate, many executives find themselves pulled in so many directions that they&#x2019;ve lost touch with their ultimate purpose.  Most are exceedingly &#x201c;active,&#x201d; but far less &#x201c;productive&#x201d; than they could be.  Further, many other leaders have lost their ability to utilize their gut instinct, which led them into business in the first place.<br>
<br>
Clarity is POWER.<br>
<br>
Odds are you don't need more &quot;advice.&#x201d;  But you could probably use more &quot;CLARITY.&quot; What I bring to the table is an expertise around getting you to perform at your very best.<br>
<br>
Whether you&#x2019;re struggling, stressed out, or at your best now...I can guide you to greater CLARITY that&#x2019;s aligned with your unique purpose, personality and professional style.<br>
<br>
&#x25ba; Take the MindScan thought assessment - FREE.  And then call me to schedule a complimentary session to review your profile ($500 value).  The MindScan is an amazing tool that actually measures your thoughts to identify specific gaps that are diminishing your performance. <br>

        <p class="groups">
          While I'm not much for fancy credentials...after all these years I'd say I've got a PhD in results.  <br>
<br>
There are many coaching and consulting certifications available in the market place...but you just can't teach this.<br>
<br>
If you or your team is overwhelmed, lacking motivation, in need of better time management, struggling in any way at all...or doing better than ever and you just want more...I can help.<br>
<br>
Success is 80 to 90 percent between your ears and only 1- to 20 percent execution.  Having coached and consulted with hundreds of professionals over the years, it has become evident that &quot;advice&quot; is rarely effective.  What works perfectly for one, will often crash and burn for another.<br>
<br>
Clarity is POWER.  When you understand yourself and your own thinking...success is inevitable.
