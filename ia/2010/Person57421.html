    <h2>David Maxson&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        Thanks for taking the time to come by and check out my profile.  If you are an employer or a recruiter I appreciate your time up front.<br>
<br>
For the last 14 years I have had the privilege few people get in their lives, to do a vocation that they enjoy.  I got to pastor a church.  If you are not a spiritual person, I cannot explain it well enough but I never received as much satisfaction in any job then I have in this one.  Just as God leads people into a ministry, He also leads them out.  I am stepping out of my role as pastor and looking for a new role to take on, preferable one in manufacturing, as I like to tell my wife, I need to make widgets again.  I never expected that I would step out of ministry, but this is the best choice at this moment.<br>
<br>
I am a practical hard working individual.  I have strong work ethic and desire to do the best work every single time I set off to do anything.  That is the core of who I am.  I have that reputation, and I am pleased with being known for that.  <br>
<br>
Listed below are the different roles I have taken on in my life,  I have many life experiences.<br>
<br>
My Career Goals:<br>
I always want to start this with, &quot;My last career will be...&quot; I have worked for two organizations in the last 26 years.  That is amazing I am told, when most people switch jobs every three to four years.  But I like long term employments, especially with the right companies.  Meade was great because I got to do so much when I was there.  When I started there it was a smaller machine shop, so I had to help do many tasks outside of my department,  I had to participate because that is what got me a paycheck each week.  As the company grew,  my ability to do many tasks didn't change, I still was involved everywhere, though my focus was in machining.  <br>
<br>
I am not looking for a job, nor am I looking for a challenge.  I am looking for an opportunity to use my skills and talents to help a company make a profit plain and simple.

      <h4 class="org summary">Yucca Valley Church of the Nazarene</h4>
  <p class="organization-details">(Religious Institutions industry)</p>
  <p class="period">

 &mdash; <abbr class="dtstamp" title="2010-01-10">Present</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P14Y4M">(14 years 4 months)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">I have the joy of working with this local congregation for 14 years, during this time we grew numerically to require multiple services and add ministries to our outreach to the community.  We were effective in becoming one of the best recognized congregations in the community for their efforts to be involved in the community.   <br>
<br>
As pastor, my task is to look forward.  To see the church as it can be in the future and help it try to get there.  It causes pastors to be change agents, sometimes people like that, and sometimes people don't.  The only constant in people's lives is change, but we resist change interestingly enough.  <br>
<br>
For the church to stay relevant, that is effective, we have had to utilize technology, improve communication and enable leadership differently.   I have been successful in that, I have sent leadership from our church all over the United States serving and working with other congregations.  I have other local churches come and ask me how to bring technology into their services and how to best do it.  I am a mentor, leader and friend.  <br>
<br>
The other thing to talk about is choices.  As a leader there are some choices you get the chance to have others assist you in making, some choices are made for you and still others are choices you get to make.  I do not shy away from making choices.  I make them thoughtfully, taking in the whole picture and I move forward.  Over 14 years I have made a few bad decisions, but many more great decisions.  All those choices have improved me.<br>
<br>
I believe the life experiences I have gained from being a pastor make this a memorable vocation.</p>

      Production Control Manager
    
      </h3>
      <h4 class="org summary">Meade Instruments</h4>
  <p class="organization-details">(Machinery industry)</p>
  <p class="period">
        <abbr class="dtstart" title="1993-01-01">January 1993</abbr>
 &mdash; <abbr class="dtend" title="1995-01-01">January 1995</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P2Y1M">(2 years 1 month)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">I came into this position because of a vacancy created by the leaving of an excellent Material Manager.  <br>
<br>
This was a position I enjoyed because it allowed me to solely do what I did for years as machine shop manager, planning, estimating, accomplishing the goal of production.  <br>
<br>
I did this position in conjunction with information managing.  It compromised about 70% of my time as I worked to get parts from raw to WIP to wherever they needed to go after that, to get back ready for final assembly.  <br>
<br>
My knowledge of manufacturing and the processes were critical in assisting the machine shop do the right part at the right moment. I helped plan bills of material, I helped work out lead time for MRP and helped execute that MRP monthly.</p>

      Manager
    
      </h3>
      <h4 class="org summary">Information Systems  Meade Instruments</h4>
  <p class="organization-details">(Machinery industry)</p>
  <p class="period">
        <abbr class="dtstart" title="1993-01-01">January 1993</abbr>
 &mdash; <abbr class="dtend" title="1995-01-01">January 1995</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P2Y1M">(2 years 1 month)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">I have a vast background in technology and back in 1990 we were still using mainframes to manage data for mid-size companies like Meade.  <br>
<br>
I came into this position much like the planner position because of the leaving of an excellent Material Manager.  He gets the credit for introducing the technology.  I get the credit for maintaining it, and keeping the company connected.   When Meade moved to a new facility, I connected all the terminals to the mainframe, wiring them and maintaining the physical plant.  I did minor programing to the ASK manman software and produced reports for management.  It was after this move we upgraded to a new mainframe.  I managed its purchased and oversaw its install and brought it online within a day or two.  <br>
<br>
My other responsibility was the purchasing and maintaining of personal computers.  As 486 machines became inexpensive, Meade began to use more and more of them and I purchased them, created small networking systems not connected to the mainframe, purchased software for the company and trained people on the use of that software.</p>

      Machine Shop Supervisor
    
      </h3>
      <h4 class="org summary">Meade Instruments</h4>
  <p class="organization-details">(Machinery industry)</p>
  <p class="period">
        <abbr class="dtstart" title="1985-01-01">January 1985</abbr>
 &mdash; <abbr class="dtend" title="1995-01-01">January 1995</abbr>        <abbr class="duration" title="P10Y1M">(10 years 1 month)</abbr>
  </p>
    <p class="description">This was my longest assignment at Meade.  <br>
<br>
I supervised the daily tasks and projects of up to 60 employees during five shifts. including the manual machining department and the CNC deparment. I had 7 department supervisors reporting to me.<br>
<br>
Oversaw all aspects of plant management, which included the repair of all machine shop machines and CNC machines to facilitate ongoing production.  We repaired almost all of our machines with only a few exceptions requiring outside service providers.<br>
<br>
I was an change agent here as well, introducing computers for data transfer to the CNCs, that alone improved accuracy and reduced setup times significantly.  It also made CNC tapes obsolete.  During my tenure as our schedule became more demanding with more product, we began to find ways of reducing setup times and increasing productivity.   We standardized mill setups and utilized a central tooling center to preset all setups, reducing setup times by 2 hours per set up.  At this time we introduced additional tools that allowed the quality  of the product to be checked by the operator at the machine, reducing scrape and improving quality significantly.  <br>
<br>
Overall, this small shop that went fairly large did a great job of incorporating change and staying clean as we practiced the 5s of Lean without even knowing we were doing so.  Everything in its place, and a place for everything.<br>
<br>
I learned so much when I was here, and took that into my future experiences.  I still love the smell of a machine shop, love the sound of a lathe winding up to make a cut.</p>
