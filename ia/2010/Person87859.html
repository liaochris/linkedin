As the Vice-Chair for the Board of Directors, I have had the privilege of working with a group of business and educational leaders as we built this organization into not only one of the smartest run programs, but one that has companies clambering to be part of the learning experience for these incredibly bright students. Since being part of the Board for over a decade now, we revamped and reinvigorated the program so that students learn through informative, participatory presentations and Hands-on-Workshops (HOWsessions) that are an advanced model of active and project centric learning environments which are changing education and corporate training processes. Along with Director Huy Ngo from SCAD, we have also developed an online test that has streamlined the admission process. As well, the entire program now relies solely on a series of INTERnet based communication transport layers to inform on each of the upcoming programs for the students, their parents, and the teaching institutions.

    <p class="description">Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) is the largest private Art and Design College in the world.

<br>
As SCAD&#x2019;s first VP of ONline Learning, we were able to make history by tactically moving the institution forward with a comprehensive model for eLearning. By delivering faculty training (including laptops for all faculty), combined with infusing supplemental online information into the pedagogy, the College successfully flipped the education model to a student centered anytime anywhere learning experience. Today, SCAD has over 15 degrees of study offered completely online, as well as all courses of study for F2F students, have supplemental online information.<br>
<br>
My role as VP of Online Learning also included building/delivering educational models that repurpose knowledge based content and promote active/project centered learning within eLearning mediums, as well as managing curriculum and pedagogical planning processes with training for all faculty and staff. Primary to this were both the eLearning system we built for testing and managing content related to multimedia course work developed by faculty, as well as factoring intellectual property and copyright parameters into faculty contracts for a win win between the institution and the faculty.</p>
