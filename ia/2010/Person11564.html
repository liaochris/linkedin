  </p>
    <p class="description">I founded ISVfocus.com Limited in 2007; it owns my commercial projects and acts as publisher of my blogs. <br>
<br>
As I wanted to learn about blogging, and it helps to write about something you know, I started a blog about SaaS. The ISV Survival blog delivers news, reviews and original content on SaaS. <br>
<br>
While writing the ISV Survival blog, I became interested in the technology ISVs use to build and deploy SaaS applications. This builds on my more than 25 years experience in the IT industry; for most of that time I built, sold and supported development tools for ISVs and enterprise users.<br>
<br>
Many of my customers were ISVs that used our development tools to build vertical enterprise applications. I started the paasTalk blog in March 2008 to share my thoughts on PaaS. In particular, what PaaS will mean to ISVs on how they build and deploy applications.<br>
<br>
Advised a large Indian outsourcer on approaching German ISVs, and redesigned a number of corporate websites. <br>
 <br>
In Q4/08 -  Q1/09 I acted as COO for a core banking startup raising VC. This involved detailed work on the business plan and financial model, as well as meetings with potential investors in Italy and the UK.<br>
<br>
Seeing a gap in the broader training market, I launched the SellToCamera blog in September 2009 to help business professionals learn to present on video. This new blog combines my 25+ years of presentation experience with my firm conviction that selling direct to camera on video is a core skill we must all acquire to be successful in our increasingly visual world.<br>
<br>
The name SellToCamera seemed apt for a blog talking about selling directly to the camera, getting your message across motivating your audience to take action. You are not selling your product or service directly is a short video, rather you are selling the idea of taking action; taking that vital next step. Achieve that in 2 minutes and you will be streets ahead of your competition (who are still publishing boring 40-minute screencasts).</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Joined Delta Software Technologies GmbH as VP International Business Development to drive new business and set up strategic partnerships. The company acquired the rights to the Delta/ADS enterprise application development tool in 1994.<br>
<br>
Designed and implemented strategy to move company away from its rigid traditional development focus and towards how to become a successful software products business. This required quite a lot of internal discussion and selling to start to move away from the traditional business model.<br>
<br>
Worked closely with resellers in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France to relaunch their business and create a plan for growth, focusing on the traditional markets where Delta/ADS was strong: larger banks and insurance companies<br>
<br>
Founded Delta Software Technology Italia S.r.l. in Turin and submitted a joint bid with CSC for the massive &quot;INPS&quot; project to modernize Italy's pension administration and payment system. It was interesting to see how a company was formed in Italy, and how different it was to previous experience in the UK and Germany.<br>
<br>
Presented at international trade conferences and raised the visibility of the company with updated positioning, branding, web presence, product packaging and a focus on product quality. Also spoke at a number of customer and partner events to raise the image of Delta and to be seen as more of a modern product company.<br>
<br>
Introduced the &quot;Solution Selling&quot; process for prospecting and sales management to resellers with custom training materials and real-time support. Helped sales team to achieve targets when prospecting and processing the sales pipeline by learning to say &quot;no&quot;. This might sound like a small thing, but it is sometime difficult in the heat of a sales process to take a step back and see what really needs to be done. In a number of situations saying no quickly resulted in a sales process become unblocked and substantial additional sales being made.</p>

<br>
Pitched Dynasty to VCs in Houston, Europe and Japan. Wrote business plans and supporting documents for a successful $5M funding round. This was my first direct involvement with the investment community the USA, Europe and Japan, and it was very enlightening to see first hand the difference in approaches.<br>
<br>
Appointed VP Strategy and Marketing and drove strategic shift to promote applications developed using the DDE through Dynasty's international sales channel. The main application partner was CAD IT (Italy) with SIBAC Core Banking which was conceived to target a large, profitable vertical market.<br>

    <p class="description">Founded Attitude Software in the UK to focus on Windows-based application development and object-oriented design. This was my first hands-on experience with OO; the tools I had been working on up until this point were based more on the concepts of Jackson Structured Programming. I developed a number of niche commercial applications during this period using Borland Delphi, at least one of which is still running unchanged today.<br>
<br>
Performed in-depth quality assurance review of PC-based development product for German software tools company. This project covered both the software and the supporting documentation. Travelled to Germany regularly to report on progress. Also developed an automated Windows-based product demonstration for use at trade shows and other sales events.<br>
<br>
I also translated a programming standards manual from German to English for BMW.</p>

      VP Product Development
    
      </h3>
      <h4 class="org summary">IBSI Case Development GmbH (Delta)</h4>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Joined Delta Software International Ltd 1988 to manage the IBM mainframe team for the Delta/ADS enterprise application development tool. This was initially a mostly technical role with an important element of negotiation with head office in Switzerland and fellow development centre in Germany.<br>
<br>
Delta/ADS was the market leader in its niche in Europe and was used by many large banks and insurance companies, which meant customer visits and general pre-sales and post-sales support, both in the UK and internationally.<br>
<br>
Moved to Germany in 1990 to join Delta Software GmbH after managing the UK development organization and working closely with development teams in Germany and Switzerland. Started to learn German, where my progress was helped by my colleagues deciding one day to stop speaking English to me.<br>
<br>
Quickly appointed Development Group Manager for German development team, which meant close liaison with development groups in Switzerland and France, as well as strategic sub-contractors in Germany.<br>
<br>
In 1991 this team was spun-out of Delta Software GmbH into a separate company, IBSI CASE Development GmbH, following Delta's acquisition by IBSI (a big Delta/ADS user in France). This meant even more travel, this time mostly to France and Switzerland, and my first attempt to learn French.<br>
<br>
Managed a team of 20 with profit and loss responsibility and a turnover of EUR 2 million for IBSI CASE Development GmbH; profit and loss, hire and fire responsibility. Drove the technical strategy and supported international sales. Spoke at a number of user conferences and customer events.<br>
<br>
Assumed VP Product Development position in 1993 with transfer of all Delta/ADS development to IBSI CASE Development GmbH, at which point the development centers in France and Switzerland were closed.</p>

<br>
Managed 4 people on project for the Equity &amp; Law insurance company to develop a replacement Broker Funds management application within a tight timescale of six months. This project was based onsite within the end-user department, so I had daily contact with both the end-users and senior management. This project was done under the radar of the IT department, so some political skills also came into play.<br>
<br>
Consulted on a range of development projects for M&amp;G Investments, The Salvation Army, Harrods, Desoutter, Cullinet, Hitachi and TRW. Again, these projects were a mixture of pre-sales, post-sales, hands-on development and technical consulting.</p>
