    <h2>Terrell Hull, MSIM, PMP&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        A veteran IT leader with over 20 years' experience and a deep technical background, Terrell has earned a reputation as a &quot;consummate software professional.&quot; His ruthless focus on results-oriented management, optimal business-IT alignment, and lean, evidence-driven IT investments &quot;contribute directly to the client's bottom line.&quot;  A &quot;rare blend of intellect and action,&quot; his &quot;approachable demeanor&quot; helps him close gaps between executive management and IT.  With a broad IT background ranging from financial, automotive, logistics, marketing, genetic research, and robotics, to defense and aerospace projects, Terrell is a leading authority on requirements engineering, managing projects, object technology, and enterprise architecture.<br>
<br>
NORAD hired Terrell based on a referral from Grady Booch to oversee the Space Warning Systems Center (SWSC) upgrade, where he developed a set of OO design metrics to achieve quality control objectives, which were presented at the World Software Technology Conference by the team.  In July, 2006, Terrell conducted a seminar at Northrop Grumman for the Software Process Improvement Network (SoCal SPIN) entitled &quot;Use Cases: A Holistic Approach to Requirements Extraction for Aerospace Systems,&quot; attended by an audience of aerospace dignitaries and military leaders (see link).<br>
<br>
Dr. Harvey Deitel, author of Java: How to Program, dedicated his 5th ed. to Terrell for his &quot;commitment to excellence in teaching and writing about... object technology,&quot; and for his &quot;extraordinary contributions [to Prentice Hall publications].&quot;  He has been featured as a distinguished speaker at numerous industry conferences, such as Int'l Advisor DevCon Java/Websphere Conference, ObjectWest, LogicWorks Intl, and elsewhere.

When it became clear that the team had fallen into &quot;analysis paralysis,&quot; use cases were ambiguous and unusable, and key abstractions had not been clearly identified, the program manager assigned Terrell to bring the project to center.<br>
<br>
    &#x2022; Established a SoftWare Architecture Team (SWAT) consisting of 20-30 consultants organized into 2-3 person &quot;tiger teams&quot; to accelerate development and provide a more centrally-focused architectural approach<br>
    &#x2022; Defined 36 &quot;core&quot; use cases (subsuming the existing use cases)<br>
    &#x2022; Designed a comprehensive core application framework in only 7 weeks<br>
    &#x2022; Team produced first &quot;thin slide&quot; prototype in project history, which integrated all technologies, demonstrating the ability to post payments accurately and efficiently from multiple clients.  <br>
    &#x2022; Prototype tied together disparate technologies, some still experimental at the time, such as a beta version of BEA Millenia 3 (code-named &quot;Iceberg&quot;), and a pre-released verion of a C++ interface to the Neuron Data inference engine<br>
    &#x2022; After presenting the prototype to Norwest investors and affiliates, more resources were added to the Terrell's SWAT team, following which all mission-critical component development fell to his team.<br>

    <p class="description">Developed an end-to-end system architecture and detailed system design for an imaging system using Rational Rose and C++ round-trip engineering tools, as well as providing training in object-oriented analysis and design using the Booch method and the Rational tools suite.  Designed and coded a &quot;thunking&quot; application (thunking is the transformation between 16-bit and 32-bit instruction formats ) to connect a 16-bit Windows 3.11 application (developed by Wheb systems) to a 32-bit Windows NT DLL (created by a third-party company), in fulfillment of an ultimatum from VISA (their largest client) to demonstrate the compatibility of their application with Windows NT, after Microsoft consultants had called the task impossible, and refused to participate.  <br>
<br>
Used a combination of C++, inline assembler, and an intimate knowledge of i386 chip architecture to build a working set of thunking APIs to facilitate the task.  One of the most important APIs was responsible for transparently delegating 16-bit function calls to 32-bit DLL calls including return values and an argument list whose signature was different from call to call (using a non-terminating argument list), along with a memory &quot;scratchpad&quot; that was visible to both environments, which required the APIs to rearrange the call stack directly (using assembler) at run-time so that stack values (using the PASCAL calling convention) could be passed and returned properly to the caller (using a C calling convention). <br>
<br>
    &#x2022; The resulting thunking application did the &quot;impossible,&quot; reconciling a 16-bit application with a 32-bit DLL in such a manner that the application remained untouched, as did the DLL, by introducing a series of marshaling layers standing in for the two components that coordinating complex interactions, including successfully transmitting 10,000+ element three-dimensional collections that often were allocated in the application and freed in the DLL, and vice-versa.</p>
