    <h2>Joseph Crawford&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        I started out with the internet in 1994 when i bought my first computer with my own money.  I started getting into web development in 1997 by viewing the source code for HTML and then picking up ASP.  About a year after using ASP I found PHP and decided to make the switch.<br>
<br>
I have been using PHP since 1998.  I started to really get involved with web development while creating and managing my own websites.  I hit the books hard and started reading everything I could find on website development.  I decided not to focus on anything design related but to go for the back-end development.<br>
<br>
My library has grown over the years and I have learned so much from all of the dedicated authors who have written the books.<br>
<br>
In 2005 I started up my own company Codebowl Solutions, Inc.  While it was successful I decided to grab a full-time position.  Most of my positions have been remote positions where I work from home, however the more recent positions have been in-house.  I like working both from home and in the office.

    <p class="description">Tatto Media is a smart advertising company with intelligent platforms that produce immediate results.  Tatto Media was founded in 2005 in Boston, Massachusetts. Over the past four years, the company has applied its expertise in performance advertising to display advertising and virtual currency. Tatto Media&#x2019;s development of next generation advertising platforms is revolutionizing online advertising.<br>
<br>
Making use of Cake PHP and PHP 5 I have been tasked to create a bidding system where advertisers can log-in and create bids. Bids are based on a set of criteria and a dollar amount they wish to pay for each conversion. I am also working on the Tatto Display network which is a much larger project in the ad space.<br>
<br>
More recently I have been using Ubuntu as my desktop at work and have been given tasks on another large project. I<br>
am now working on the Tatto Publishers and Advertisers network. I have been working on the reporting section and integrating ajax flash charts (FusionCharts) which will work seamlessly with the reporting. Working with technologies such as rsync, scp, ssh, svn, PHP 5 and the CakePHP framework.</p>

    <p class="description">Namespace's goal is to create a URL Free internet, they believe that everything should be run by keywords. Partnering<br>
with ISP companies they are turning this vision into a reality.<br>
<br>
Working with PHP 5, CSS, JavaScript, XML, CSV, HTML I have created a new reporting system for their clients using Object Oriented PHP 5. The reporting system allows the client to get at the data using various methods. They can access the web front-end to visually view the data in the browser and download CSV or XML formats as well. They can specify several parameters to get the report data that they wish. The parameters are those such as start and end dates, the report format, and the report type. The clients also have the ability to fetch the data using methods such as cURL or wGet over HTTPS. They can fetch whichever format they would like the results to be in. Adding this functionality allows the clients to integrate the report system into their own internal systems doing what they wish with the data.<br>
<br>
The next project that I am starting on is ISP Keywords. This system will allow the customers to update their set of keywords using an API or web front-end to automate the process. The team at Namespace was a rather small team.  The entire company consisted of 4 employees and the owner. I was the sole developer at this position. I left this position in favor of a permanent position with Tatto Media.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">Working at Castle Communications turned out to be a great experience.  I was working with some really talented people who knew what they wanted and how to get the job done.<br>
<br>
My first few tasks were to integrate a full CSS layout that was provided to me into the Webdate.com codebase.  This was a tedious task to complete because the site was under no template control.  All of the code was mixed in with the HTML markup for the site.  <br>
<br>
I was also tasked with the responsibility of rewriting the mobile API they had for Webdate.  The mobile API was not that complex and when I rewrote it we did so in a way that was RESTful and made use of the companies internal framework.  Our API provided all of the data necessary and a 3rd party company displayed it to the end user in a format their phone would understand.  The data was in pipe delimited format and included binary photos.  <br>
<br>
When the above tasks were completed I was put on the Politics.com project. This was a rather large project that they had planned and it was to be a Web 2.0 Social Networking site.  The site had many of the features you would see on sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Myspace.  You could do such things as uploading photos, videos, making comments, starting debates and managing your friends and foes.<br>
<br>
Most sites end with the friend relationship however we took it a step further and allowed you to add someone to a foes list.  Once they were marked as your foe you were the only one who could remove it and they would not be able to send you messages.  We also used a 3rd party web service to gather the data on the politicians for use on our politician map and pages.<br>
<br>
I was able to work on these projects using the following technologies: PHP 4/5, MySQL, CSS, JavaScript (Ajax, jQuery).  I was also working remotely most of the time making the occasional<br>
trip into the offices in Timonium MD and Alexandria VA.  I was using SVN and SSH to make working remotely possible.</p>

    <p class="description">Working on converting their existing Microsoft based solution over the the LAMP stack.  I started by creating a job portal using PHP 5, JavaScript, CSS.  You could search the jobs that were in our database and as you did they were plotted on a Google Maps mashup.  As you zoomed into a particular area on the map (ie. Boston) the search results would be filtered to only show what was on the map.<br>
  <br>
This project also allowed recruiters to purchase posting packs that would allow them to post jobs to the site.  I was also asked to look into the ability to have a single sign on page for their network of sites.  After a lot of research and consideration we opted not to do this because of how complex it is to complete.  We were using the CodeIgniter PHP framework for rapid development and to gain the MVC advantage.<br>
<br>
This position ended up turning into a Full Time employment position and was only short term due to personal reasons, please inquire as to why.</p>

    <p class="description">Developer however so much work came up and they had me hire and supervise 4 other developers under the company Codebowl Solutions.  I managed the team to meet the short deadlines they had and when we finished the site was on a solid path to success.  This site was 100% custom PHP 5 which made use of external web services and had a lot of calculations.<br>
<br>
LicketyShip is a same day delivery service provider.  You could go on their site and place an order for products that you needed.  They would have them delivered to your home or office within 2-4 hours and the prices for delivery started around $20.<br>
<br>
All of the products on the site were scoured from a partner company by screen scraping with permission.  The partner company wanted to see just how much being a part of this delivery service would increase its revenue before having their developers create an API for consumption.  In order to accurately calculate the delivery cost for the products we had to get the actual turn by turn directions and calculate the total street miles vs using a radius based on zip code like most companies do on their sites.  Once we had the total street miles we were able to run calculations based on the couriers cost per mile, cost per minute wait time, etc.  We used these calculations to choose the best delivery provider and shortest route for the customer so that costs were kept down.  In order to alert the couriers we also had to integrate with an online faxing service so that a fax would be sent to the courier notifying them of the scheduled delivery.<br>
<br>
Since my departure with this company they had changed names and switched from the LAMP stack over to Microsoft .NET.  Soon after they made the platform change they closed the doors for good.  I left this position because it was a start-up which agreed upon a 50 hour work week however they continued to try to force me to work 16 hour days.  Using technologies such as PHP 5, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SVN, SSH, VPN, SOAP.</p>
