  </p>
    <p class="description">Started working on a moonlight project outside of my normal day job at Bell Labs. Developed a series of high-level programs which could be offered to the general public on a &quot;minutes-of-use basis&quot; that permitted businesses or hobbyist computers system users to be tied into a mammoth scale, time shared system, and network.<br>
<br>
The programs ranges from simple programs to balance personal check books and perform personal finances, and also to maintain retail inventory level based on the use of a small computer systems as one of the very first retail &quot;active&quot; POS cash registers where the small computer was being linked to CompuServe as a &quot;glass teletype&quot;.<br>
<br>
Some of the programs included classic recreational on-line games, scientific calculations, finance, various card games, checkers, and a chess Game and similar board games to get users to spend million of dollars having during all night sessions of romping though the computers and spending money for every minute of it.. <br>
<br>
Also, developed an entire small business accounting software package to include General Ledger, Accounts Receivable/Payable, Personnel/Payroll, and related functions for dial up users.<br>
<br>
Paid strictly on a percentage-of-play basis, so that I only got paid from the billable proceeds where/if customers were spending their money.  In 1978 this became the Radio Shack and MicroNET project, and it exploded in popularity, and eventually lead the way towards the Videotex services.<br>
<br>
I continued to perform part-time moonlight programming while in the military and continued to come out with some fairly popular programs, which brought in million of dollars over 11+ years. I also started, administered and moderated several popular discussions forums of technical subject matters. <br>
<br>
Heavy work in PDP-10 Assembler Programming.<br>
<br>
Sold the rights to all software fully to CompuServe in 1987 to start Granite Island Group,partly for cash, and partly for stock. (70001.xxx user name plank owner).</p>

<br>
Machines used included the now antique IBM 026 Printing Card Punch (which used vacuum tubes), the venerable IBM 029 (no vacuum tubes), and the IBM 129 (&quot;modern machine&quot;).<br>

      <p class="notes">The combat lifesaver (CLS) is a team member trained to provide immediate emergency care. Each field team must have at least one member trained to be a combat lifesaver.<br>
<br>
On the battlefield or in hostile zones, the ability of trained medical personnel to provide immediate, far forward care is limited. Immediate far-forward first aid is essential on a widely dispersed and fluid battlefield to prevent soldiers and civilian contractors from dying of wounds. <br>
<br>
Medical personnel may not be able to reach all wounded operators at all points on the battlefield in a timely manner.  The CLS is usually a nonmedical person specially trained to provide advanced first aid and immediate lifesaving procedures beyond the level of self-aid or buddy aid.  <br>
<br>
The CLS is not intended to take the place of medical personnel, but to slow deterioration of the wounded until medical personnel arrive. Functioning as a CLS is a secondary mission undertaken only when the tactical situation permits.</p>

<br>
The WJ-32320 was a truck-mobile, self-deploying 0.5 to 18+ GHz ELINT/ESM system with a high probability of intercept threat-warning broadband IFM receiver. It has an omnidirectional and monopulse instantaneous direction-finding antenna subsystem, a high-sensitivity and precision analysis superheterodyne subsystem, and a high-gain spinning direction-finding antenna subsystem. <br>
<br>
Capabilities include: extended pulse and waveform analysis; emitter AOA determination, parameterisation, library identification and analysis; emitter geolocation and tracking with integrated GPS, compass and colour mapping; digital recording of signal data, maps, logging, reports and mission scenarios; digital simulation of emitters for multi-emitter/multiplatform/multi-operator training and RF simulation of emitters for training and testing.</p>

<br>
This course provided a better understanding of why private investigators and police have historically had a really tough or impossible time actually finding bugs and wiretaps, and why PI's and police should never be engaged to find bugs or wiretaps.</p>

Attended over sixty Silicon Graphics courses over a 2 year period, involving long periods spent in SGI facilities near Boston, DC and on the West Coast. Heavy focus on refining software development skills for a special project, involving the coding of low level, extremely high performance SW, and utilization of the SGI hardware to develop a fully automated suite for SIGINT and high performance fixed and portable RF monitoring systems for TSCM, and related technical counterintelligence activities.</p>

Attended multiple ADPA, Apple Developer University, Mac Developer Program, and related design courses. <br>
<br>
Became certified as both a software and hardware developer on the original Macintosh platforms. <br>
<br>
Primary focus was using the Macintosh as a high performance signals intelligence workstation where the superior performance of the Mac (at the time) was leveraged. <br>
<br>
As a result of these courses I learned enough about Mac to design several high speed digitizers and frame grabbers, plus a modulation recognition hardware and software product used for SIGINT and TSCM. <br>
<br>
Developed the methods involved in modifying TSCM equipment and electronic test equipment to give the Mac workstations direct memory access so that the high speed memory of the test equipment essentially became the extended memory of the Mac itself (something that was tough to do with IBM PC's at the time).</p>

Because the ultimate value of the analytical process is to obtain meaning from the available information, the course emphasized the rapid development, assessment, and communications of inferences to uncover, exploit, and neutralize all types of terrorist activities.<br>

Ownership and operation of  this equipment provided to a huge asset to my TSCM operations as this was the best-of-the-best signals intelligence gear available which I retrofitted into a mobile lab environment, which Granite Island Group could bring to any site in North America.

      <p class="notes">One hundred twenty hour course (3 weeks) on Z-80 Assembly Language Programming, followed by forty hours (1 week) of hardware CPU development, and twenty hours (3 days) of external interfaces.<br>
<br>
I initially attended the computer programing course to fine-tune my Z-80 software development skills, but was invited to stay for the hardware design courses as well even though I was not an electronics engineer at the time. <br>
<br>
This course proved to be a major catalyst in my future as it got me excited about low level hardware development and instead of working on the &quot;upper layers&quot; of the computer and merely writing software I developed an intense hunger to work with and develop things at the circuit board and component level.</p>

      <p class="notes">Course on the operation, and programming of the Hewlett Packard 8580A Automatic Spectrum Analyzer that combined both the HP2100 Computer and the HP855X spectrum analyzer plug-in family and created the worlds very first Fully Automatic Spectrum Analyzer System.<br>
<br>
The 140 series oscilloscope mainframes and 855X SA Plug-in series were basic core of these systems, so I first had first to learn to master running the (all analog) Spectrum Analyzer system using numerous modules to cover the 20 Hz - 40 GHz spectrum.<br>
<br>
These were used for  automated &quot;Spectrum Monitoring&quot; to detect bugs present in high risk areas and to maintain watching over the airwaves of an area. Also used for surveillance, system monitoring, electronic compatibility testing, TEMPEST testing, and electronic intelligence. <br>
<br>
This was the very first HP fully computerized and fully automated spectrum analyzer, until replaced by the HP8566 and HP8569, which became the flagship Automatic Microwave Spectrum for HP.</p>
