    <p class="description">Reporting to the unit manager, responsible for line mgt, including objective setting, appraisals and coaching on personal development points not included in formal objectives process. Responsible in planning and tracking of all works  carried out by 2 teams of developers, one for FX Derivatives IT (10 FTE) and one for Money Markets IT (3 FTE). All project management activities were carried out in accordance with an adapted PMBOK methodology, using the triple constraint to measure project success.<br>
Money Markets projects included:<br>
1.	Re-engineering of the firms overnight batch process for trade lifecycle and valuation.<br>
2.	Implementing a Swapswire interface to existing trade capture system, together with a full reconciliation between Swapswire and the back office platform.<br>
3.	Coordinating small works (&lt;1000 hours) to augment effort of London staff for quarterly releases.<br>
FX Derivatives projects included 3 releases of a Trade and Risk viewer, which allowed users to have a consolidated view of their positions.<br>
The team originally included 2 testers. I felt that having them in the unit meant that they were not exposed to best practices, and that moving them to GSDCs dedicated testing unit, but ring-fencing them for our use, gave them better coaching opportunities and a more optimal career path.<br>
I contributed to office management process by producing several tools using MS Excel VBA and MS Project 2003 VBA.<br>
Previously, the FX team was largely working in an ad-hoc fashion, responding reactively to a low pipeline of works received from the London team. I met with the Technical Function head of FX Derivatives IT, and presented a case for the team to work on bigger, more directed, projects. Shortly following this discussion, responsibility for all business as usual activities, for the majority of existing  FX Derivatives systems, was transferred to the GSDC team. Some 5800 hrs of work was then estimated and planned for the entire pipeline of outstanding work</p>

    <p class="description">Responsible for Equity Linked Technology in the Asia Pacific region, covering delta one, flow and exotic equity derivatives.<br>
 I implemented a governance structure  after discussion, and in line with, global counterparts. This improved transparency to the business, empowered them to more easily make critical decisions, and improved the efficiency and understanding of the development teams themselves. I recruited over 20 staff to both replace and improve existing weaknesses.<br>
The warrants market making team was understaffed, and working on a legacy platform using outdated technology. This led to an excess of outages. The global solution was clearly not suitable for the Asian markets, I recruited a new market making team in Hong Kong, and transitioned legacy support to a separate group. A new platform, using some of the global components, was developed, and this was successfully rolled out to cover the Hong Kong warrants market, and futures arbitrage in Japan. The new system was running with 20 warrants within the first week of operation.<br>
There was no dedicated effort applied to rapid application development. I recruited a front-office solutions team, who were able to remediate the majority of major business issues, and provide development capability to the exotics desk. I again transitioned support to the dedicated support group, thus freeing up the developers time.<br>
All of the teams had their own support staff, leading to inefficiency and loss of development time. Systems knowledge was sparse, and this situation led to the risk that all support skills would be lost if one person left the team. Working closely with the equities operational services team (Trade Plant) we initially recruited 2 senior support staff, and expanded this later to 7 regionally. Headcount was reallocated from the previous core services group. This led to a marked improvement in operational management, and allowed on-boarding of a further 14 applications.</p>

In response to the lack of available talent within the Hong Kong labour market, I created an offshore risk management development team, for which I hired an experienced team lead in Singapore, who was responsible for 3 Consultants, with a remit to deliver against major risk management projects for the business. This initiative was the first globally where front office IT development had been attempted offshore. Major trade capture re-engineering across all derivatives business lines in the bank are now benefiting from global projects being developed by the Singapore trade capture team. Offshoring within my responsibility was at 39%, with a target of 50% before the end of 2006.<br>
In late December 2005, I played a major hands-on role in delivering a risk management system for the Korean Warrants market-making business in Seoul.<br>
As part of the leadership team, I participated in Securities IT Senior Management meetings including production of frameworks documents for Client, People and Technology management, proscribing roles and responsibilities for all managers in these categories. These were used to manage the whole of Securities IT. I was personally responsible for the Application Management Framework initiative, which presented clear guidelines and example documentation to Application Managers, providing them with a set of operational minimum standards and best practices. Through the existing company performance management system, objectives would be set for each individual to comply with these frameworks. Thus, individuals could be advised on development points, and their careers managed appropriately.</p>

Liaising with all levels of the business, to ensure support and development needs were met.<br>
Pioneered the offshoring of derivatives systems development by setting up a trade capture centre of excellence in the company's global business centre in Singapore. The team of 3 consultants reported to a team leader business analyst in Hong Kong, who was himself recruited internally for this position. The team subsequently produced exotic trade capture screens for Accumulator options, timer options, trigger redeemable swaps and callable equity linked notes. Mainly due to the trade capture effort, and other process re-engineering, straight through processing of OTC options went from practically zero percent to (up to) 80% of all OTC options traded. <br>
Regulatory-driven risk management system remediation projects accounted for 50% of the total work carried out across the bank globally. Hired individuals specifically for resourcing these projects.<br>
Relocated the Japan OTC desk (3 traders) to Tokyo from Hong Kong, at a time when regulatory pressure had forced other institutions to move out of Japan. Hired local IT support to cover this desk.</p>

Re-engineered the global convertibles risk management system to cater for regional differences in architecture and rolled out to the convertibles bond desk. Captured a large portion of regional risk using this system, for risk measurement and management purposes. Completed the project to deliver convertibles desk P&amp;L in a timely fashion to the back office systems. Led the project to replace existing white-box technology, for Monte-Carlo compute engines, with IBM Blade Frame technology, resolving architectural issues to deliver the project on time and under budget. Created an automation process that extracts trades from the equity exchange execution system and feeds them into the derivatives position keeping system, thus avoiding double keying of trades into both systems, saving time and effort, reducing manual tickets, and eliminating booking errors.</p>

The system was written in C++ and used Rogue Wave Libraries (Tools.h++ and  db.h++) and Inmark's Zapp windowing product to achieve platform independence. The development platform was HP9000 running HP-UX, targeting towards Sun Microsystems hardware (processing), and IBM-compatible hardware for the man-machine interface. Databases used were Oracle v7 and Sybase v10. Inter-platform connectivity was achieved using Distributed Object Management Environment (DOME), a CORBA-compliant object request broker.</p>
