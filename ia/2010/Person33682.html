    <h2>Casey McQuillan&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        Greetings!  I have recently graduated from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science.  During my undergraduate education began my study of politics and human behavior in societies.  Additionally, I developed a keen interest in the academic debate community.  All four of the years I spent getting my degree were also spent on the UC Davis Speech and Debate team.  Here I honed several skills in public speaking and also began developing an interest in policy analysis, as this was the subject of the most competitive debates at the national tournaments.  My academic career then became about combining the information and knowledge gathered through my undergraduate education with the speaking and analytical skills honed through my debate experience.  In essence, academic debate became much like a second major.<br>
<br>
    Additionally, during the spring quarter of 2007, I took a short internship in Washington, DC with The Council for Court Excellence.  This told me a few interesting things: firstly, it confirmed that I enjoyed working in an environment based around quantitative research and policy analysis and secondly, it told me that I was very interested in returning to the District after graduating.  If my education and debate experience shaped my interest in the Public Policy field, my experience in the District gave me the best environment to pursue this passion.  <br>
<br>
     Ultimately, I hope to begin a public policy career here in the District, and after gaining some work experience in the field I would like to pursue a Master's of Public Policy at one of the great universities in the area.
      </p>

    <p class="description">As a Temporary Associate for Nonprofit Staffing Solutions, I am currently gaining a significant amount of experience solving complex administrative problems. The temporary assignments I have been given are often characterized by the need to learn new and complex computer systems quickly and efficiently to provide quality service to the client.<br>
Here are some interesting accomplishments for my short temporary career thus far:<br>
* I have constructed complex spreadsheets and databases from thousands of conference evaluation forms by configuring a detailed Optical Character Recognition system. This was done for an international service-workers union.<br>
* I used publishing software to develop books for infectious disease conferences for a scientific advancement nonprofit. During this time I showed the current staff new technological techniques that would allow them to automate a large portion of their desktop publishing process. In the words of my supervisor, &quot;I would have spent the next three days doing this and you just showed me I could have done it in an hour.&quot; I believe this properly illustrates the amount of effort and innovation I regularly put into solving administrative problems. I am always looking for new ways to streamline the process.<br>
* For an enterprise development nonprofit I was tasked with preparing the accounts payable records for an upcoming audit. I developed an efficient system for organizing problematic files so that the Controller and Chief Financial Officer could effectively decide their preferring course of action for reconstructing missing information.<br>
* For an executive professional association I was able to develop a series of mail-merge documents that could be used to easily draw information from their iMIS enterprise database system and generate contracts for speaking engagements, a process that will save them dozens of staff hours over the course of a year since they will no longer be required to manually edit contract information.</p>

    <p class="description">While employed with the Office of an esteemed Representative I was tasked with a primarily administrative role with several opportunities to work on legislative assignments. My general duties included sorting and routing all types of correspondence addressed to the Congressman and his staff. This included handling a high volume of incoming calls, sorting a significant amount of daily mail, and greeting/addressing the concerns of regular visitors to the office. I was also tasked with regularly attending legislative briefings of my own interest and of interest to the Congressman's staff and providing informational memorandums with my interpretation of the presented evidence. I also regularly interacted with constituents and other Capitol Hill personnel by giving exciting, pun-filled tours of the Capitol complex, writing response letters when assigned by the legislative staff, and calling other offices for pertinent information.<br>
<br>
During this time I was also assigned a number of data gathering projects which included restructuring a significant amount of data from Recovery.gov for use on the Congressman's House of Representatives website, giving statistical reports on the Congressman's voting record, and gathering information to construct large mailing lists of roughly 500 families and businesses each.</p>

    <p class="description">I served as the Student Coordinator for the UC Davis Speech and Debate Team, a student-run National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) team, for two academic debate seasons.  This job has three basic objectives:<br>
1) To grow the team.<br>
2) To oversee the team's travel to and behavior at tournaments.<br>
3) To coach and mentor the team's novice and intermediate level debaters.<br>
During my tenure as the Student Coordinators I organized team welcome meetings which would attract about 8-10 new debaters at the beginning of each season.  In addition, I trained our novice debaters in basic argument structure and delivery and arranged practice sessions for debaters of all skill levels prior to tournaments.  I handled the team's scheduling and travel to tournaments, making arrangements for hotels, cars, and the occassional flights for farther tournaments.  I was given the opportunity to manage a team budget and was able to arrange yearly fundraising activities to augment the budget for the upcoming national tournament.</p>

    <p class="description">During my internship at The Council for Court Excellence, I was given a number of projects to work on.  The major project I worked on was to develop a methodology into a quantitative study of the District of Columbia's prison system.  The objective of the study was to measure the effectiveness of the District's screening processes for criminal offenders with dually diagnosed substance abuse and mental disorders.  For minor projects, I was tasked with performing preliminary research into a guide for parents and children into the District's juvenile justice system, writing letters of support, and updating member contact information.  During my time at The CCE, I was also asked to handle other duties such as court observation, attending and tracking minutes for several meetings and events, and attending and reporting on a congressional briefing.</p>

    <p class="description">My objective at Ralph Waldo Emerson Junior High School was to give a group of interested 7th and 9th grade students a springboard into academic debate principles.  Many of these students were interested in the formalized debate circuit when they reached High School and I instructed them in basic structure of arguments, principles of public speaking, and the proper steps in responding to other structured positions.  Additionally, I took these students through several semi-formal practice debates and provided commentary to aid them in their development.  During this time I also garnered much interest among the faculty and students in using school assembly time to do public debates between the students, though we were unable to find an appropriate time during the remaining school year to implement it.</p>
