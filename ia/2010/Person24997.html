    <h2>Barb Schacher&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        With a deep appreciation for natural decorative stone, Jesse and Barb Schacher founded and own Blue Slate, Inc. a decorative stone wholesale company located in the gorgeous Northeastern corner of Washington State.<br>
<br>
Together, their passion is (and has been for the past seven years) to provide high quality, unique decorative stone to their retail customers scattered throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern California.  <br>
<br>
However, prior to becoming involved in the decorative stone industry, to Barb a rock was something that needed to be pitched out of her father&#x2019;s five acre potato patch while growing up on their cattle ranch in North-Central Idaho.  To Barb, rocks weren&#x2019;t very exciting, to say the least, way back when&#x2026;.. especially the fist sized, dull brown basalt kind that seemed to infest anew the &#x201c;spud&#x201d; patch every spring come tilling and planting time!  <br>
<br>
However, after meeting and marrying her husband, Jesse, her outlook on rock (now known to her as natural decorative stone) changed drastically.  In fact, now (as those who are involved in the decorative stone industry will tell you almost always inevitably happens) stone is just &#x201c;in her blood&#x201d; as they say.<br>
<br>
While their specialty is in the production and marketing segments of the decorative stone industry, Jesse and Barb are both passionate about all aspects of natural stone&#x2026;.. from producing it to installing it in their own real estate projects in North-Central and Northern Idaho.<br>
<br>
Jesse has been in the aggregate and decorative stone industries for nearly thirty years beginning his career as one of the original twelve employees that helped make Pacific Rock Products what it eventually became, an industry leader in the Pacific Northwest employing some 380 workers.  He managed and supervised quarries for Pac Rock, Keywitt Brothers and IRP prior to founding his own company, Cougar Ridge Stone, LLC (now known as Blue Slate, Inc.) with his wife, Barb, in 2002.

    <p class="description">Barb Schacher is co-owner (along with her husband, Jesse) of Blue Slate, Inc., a natural decorative stone wholesale company located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.      <br>
<br>
In recent years, the Schachers have specialized in producing and supplying high quality premier natural Eagle Mtn. Slate products, including flagstone, stepping stone (or patio) and building stone, to some of the industries leading decorative stone retail yards throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern California.  <br>
<br>
In addition to producing and supplying Eagle Mtn. Slate products, in 2009 Blue Slate, Inc. added a new and very exciting all natural slate chip or aggregate product called WoodStone Groundcover to their product line.  WoodStone is a gorgeous and permanent groundcover solution that looks like landscape bark yet it never needs to be replaced.  As a result, customer response to it has been fantastic. <br>
<br>
In early 2002 the Schachers founded Cougar Ridge Stone, LLC.  However, after incorporating in 2006, CRS became Blue Slate, Inc.  <br>
<br>
Jesse &amp; Barb work as a team in almost all facets of the business with both being very active in sales and customer service at Blue Slate, Inc.   <br>
<br>
Barb manages the office and has specialized in marketing the decorative stone products for both CRS and BSI since beginning the venture in 2002.  <br>
<br>
Her husband, Jesse Schacher, has worked and specialized in the aggregate and decorative stone industries for nearly 30 years.  With his vast experience and knowledge, Jesse is very respected and well known within the industry for having an &quot;eye&quot; for quality decorative stone products and the artistic talent and ability to know what his customers really want when they describe their upcoming and often unique landscape projects.   <br>
<br>
In addition, he has the production experience that enables him to supply the quality stone products his customers desire to not only make their projects a reality but to make them exceptional.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">In early 2002, Jesse and Barb Schacher founded Cougar Ridge Stone, LLC., a decorative stone company located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  <br>
<br>
CRS produced and supplied quality columnar basalt and slate products to several leading retail decorative stone sales yards throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern California until the Schachers incorporated as Blue Slate, Inc. in 2006.<br>
<br>
In addition to operating CRS, throughout the years (in their spare time..... such as it is) the Schacher&#x2019;s have designed several of their own landscape projects, produced the stone to be used in those projects and installed their landscape projects together.  <br>
<br>
With Jesse&#x2019;s artistic input, Barb has usually designed their landscape projects.  At least to begin with.  However, as married couples often do, Jesse has usually tweaked those plans (before all is said and done) to reflect his own unique and stunning vision of how the finished landscape project should look.  For some, that may be taken as &#x201c;stepping on toes&#x201d; but for Barb, it&#x2019;s been almost magical to see how Jesse&#x2019;s artistic changes and additions transform her original designs.  As a result, their landscape projects have always far exceeded her expectations.  And&#x2026;..that&#x2019;s not just good for a fantastic landscape, it's always good for a marriage:~)    <br>
<br>
During the installation phase of the projects Barb has always had the pleasure of helping with certain aspects of the installation&#x2026;.. such as laying sod, prepping flowerbeds and borders, laying weed barrier, planting shrubs and perennials, pulling &amp; disposing of weeds and&#x2026;.. well, you know, all of the &#x201c;glamorous&#x201d; aspects of landscaping!<br>
<br>
However, the actual installation of the natural stone has always been and always will be totally Jesse&#x2019;s territory.  He truly has a knack for installing a knock-out hardscape.  And, with Barb&#x2019;s blessing, he's tweaked her plans to suit his own superior, artistic vision creating absolutely gorgeous landscapes in the process:~)</p>

    <p class="description">IRP brought Jesse and Barb Schacher back home to Idaho in early 2001, for which they will always be extremely thankful simply because Idaho has been and always will be &quot;home&quot; to them.  <br>
<br>
During 2001, Jesse supervised the Iron Mountain Quarry above Newport, WA, not only exceeding but tripling the production goals that IRP set for 2001 at the Iron Mountain Quarry.<br>
<br>
2001 was also the year that Barb was first introduced to the decorative stone industry while managing the local IRP office in Newport, WA.  <br>
<br>
Despite the huge success in production during 2001 under Jesse's supervision at the Iron Mountain Quarry, unbeknowst to the Schachers, their time would be brief at IRP due to problems that eventually overwhelmed IRP at their main office and quarries located on the coast.  However, despite the short time there, Jesse and Barb gained invaluable experience and knowledge while working at IRP.  Being a novice or newcomer at the time, Barb especially will always be grateful for the experience and the introduction to the industry. <br>
<br>
When IRP closed in 2002, the Schachers decided to invest in and form their own decorative stone company.  Thus Cougar Ridge Stone, LLC was born and the rest, as they say, is history.....</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">In addition to owning a cattle ranch, Barb's dad was also the local mail carrier when she was young ~ yes, her dad really was the mailman:~)  Her grandpa (Popper) and an aunt also delivered mail on routes that took them on winding, dusty, rural gravel roads in the summer and slick, narrow rural gravel roads in the winter near the small community of Kamiah, Idaho to delivery the mail.  On top of that, Barb's mother was her dad's sub-carrier on days when he needed time off to tend to the ranch or occasionally was ill.<br>
<br>
I suppose it seems only natural that Barb would also work for the USPS.  However, with winter driving skills that were severely lacking ~ bordering on dangerous ~ Barb felt that working in the Post Office &quot;office&quot; would be a much better fit for her.  So she went to work pursuing her postal carrier at an even more rural Post Office in the backcountry of North-Central Idaho at Elk City.  <br>
<br>
While she lived in Elk City, she also developed real estate with her first husband, subdividing a 400 acre cattle ranch into large tracts or parcels overlooking Big Elk Creek along a gorgeous meadow where herds of elk  had their babies every spring and lazily grazed (with the cattle) almost year around.    <br>
<br>
Barb thoroughly enjoyed every minute of her time in Elk City, including working at the post office and developing real estate.  But most of all, she enjoyed just having the opportunity to live in such a one-of-a-kind environment.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in 1995 the couple had to relocate to Lewiston to be near the hospital due to her first husband's illness, sugar diabetes.   A few years later, he would eventually lose a short battle with a very aggressive cancer.  <br>
<br>
Barb cherished her time in Elk City and, in many ways, working at the Post Office there took her back to an innocent and safe time ~ invoking memories of sorting mail with her dad and &quot;Popper&quot; as a child back when summer days, especially, seemed so long..... without a care in the world!</p>
