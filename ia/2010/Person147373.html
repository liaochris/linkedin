    <p class="description">Board Advisory provides value by diagnosing, strategizing, designing, constructing, integrating, operating or implementing solutions.  Such consultative engagements and longer term relationships add value by gathering and synthesizing relevant knowledge, based on integrity and objectivity, in both expert and advisory roles to support sustained execution.<br>
<br>
My favorite 11 questions to catalyze execution: <br>
<br>
1. What is occupying the attention of senior management?<br>
<br>
2. What should be occupying the attention of senior management?<br>
<br>
3. Are we on a continual search for new advantages to warrant application of our offerings to the marketplace?<br>
<br>
4. Do we have the infrastructure to identify markets that we can&#x2019;t readily see today?<br>
<br>
5. Which do we value more:  keeping track of our relative competitive advantages or capturing the dynamic of competence building for the entire organization?<br>
<br>
6. What percentage of our time is spent on external rather than internal issues?<br>
<br>
7. Is there excessive intra and inter-departmental negotiation and is this visible to customers?<br>
<br>
8. Of the time spent on external concerns, what percentage of time is invested in imagining how the world could be different in five, ten or fifteen years?<br>
<br>
9. Of the time spent looking outward and forward, how much of it is spent in consultation with colleagues, where the objective is to build a deeply shared, well-tested view of the future?<br>
<br>
10. Do we have the resources to develop the new core competencies we will need to build, decide what new product concepts to pioneer, forge the alliances necessary, and determine what nascent development programs we need to protect?<br>
<br>
11. Do we understand that to have a share in the future that we must first learn to think differently about the meaning of competitiveness, strategy, and our organization?</p>

He developed and maintained competitive advantage in financial services product offerings.  He was instrumental in expanding corporate capabilities by increasing the rate at which the organization learned about the interrelationships between the customer&#x2019;s internal control environment, technology and human resources.  He created original &#x2018;knowledge-base&#x2019; of geographic multi-year comparative sales and profitability history for the corporation&#x2019;s largest 260 customers, and facilitated focus on identifying and growing strategic partnering relationships.</p>

    <p class="description">After accepting a project based assignment in Atlanta with Crawford, it was there he rose to manage the field operation charged with resolving catastrophic flood evacuation claims made by individual and commercial claimants.  He developed and implemented policies and procedures to expedite thousands of evacuation claims under environmentally difficult conditions, and pressing client deadlines.  Michael led a team to adjudicate 600 business interruption losses after the St. Louis Flood of 1993.  He successfully fulfilled client's expectations and information needs.  Earlier in his Crawford experience, he developed complex business interruption models for use in defense and settlement of product liability claims and lawsuits representing $2 billion liability to an international agribusiness client. He personally settled claims with aggregate demands exceeding $250 million.  He created original forensic accounting methodologies and computer based models to evaluate claimant and plaintiff demands. He communicated extensively with client, management, claimants, retained professionals, and claims adjusters throughout an extended settlement process.  He also assisted retained attorneys with multiple litigation support duties.</p>

      <p class="notes">Michigan was difficult for me.  I took it very seriously because of the high cost of the education, as well as the time commitment required.  My parents were sacrificing to send their son to the most expensive public university in the world.  But my goal of studying accounting at Michigan and becoming a CPA was not guaranteed when I learned of my acceptance there on March 14, 1982.  No.  First, admission was granted to the College of Literature, Science and the Arts.  Second, depending upon how well you did during your first three semesters with the liberal arts preparation curriculum, you could apply to the Michigan Business School, and spend your junior and senior year studying there to earn the coveted Michigan B.B.A. degree.  When the class of 1986 arrived at Michigan in 1982, 2,000 of 4,400 freshman identified themselves as &#x201c;pre-business&#x201d;.  However, only 312 slots were available for juniors to be admitted.  I made it, but then realized that was the easy part.</p>
