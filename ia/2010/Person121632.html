    <p class="description">Carol has given me regular gigs and seemed to give me jobs when I needed them.  At the same time she is a professional who would hire me only for work she knew I fit and I would never ask for more.  She sticks up for her employees and makes sure they get paid as well as making sure that all is done with grace and heart.  I worked Shadow Boxing 2, the sequel to Russia's first blockbuster film as a utility stand in for her.</p>

    <p class="description">I don't know if I can say what I did.  I helped with the census and it involved a great deal of walking and talking to people.  This was a Temp Job.  I don't want to work for them anymore though.  Thanks.  This job was in Los Angeles.  I worked a few days in March, then was re-hired for a few weeks late April to May.<br>
<br>
Plus my father worked for Homeland Security for years and frankly I don't want to work for the government. I need color in my life and art.  In my need to pursue happiness, I cannot make money when I have no passion for what I do, and while working for this agency I discovered they hired a woman who had worked with me on sets who participated in bullying me on a show and she had access to my personal data.  I refused to do electronic deposit for fear she would have access to my accounts.  I also know she told a supervisor false comments in my presence and told her fellow employees that they did not know they were taking away why I beat cancer.  Not true.  I will not work for the government again or be forced to because my father served enough, and frankly he took out his distaste of his job on me as a child.  I liked this job, but I can't be in an office.  I effectively quit, in case this agency has me in their records still as &quot;on-call.&quot;  If two years ago when I was told by a network I was on a list and the government had anything to do with it, that was a violation of my constitutional rights.  My family has no right to make me work in a traditional job, and though I am hard working and normally responsible, I need to work with those who trust me and know I am good at what I do, and not those who need to conduct searches or control me.  What happened two years ago effectively took away my only source of employment and everything academically I had been working for since beating cancer, but I will not accept illegal actions and slander as valid.  I have INTEGRITY.</p>

    <p class="description">I AM AN ACTRESS.  I worked for this company for over  4 years. I have the majority of my pay checks. I have worked on every studio lot in Hollywood and I did a good job.  I treated my job as background as a job.  I was not on set to date, party or goof around.  However in Dec of 2008, after telling a PA who in 2009 told me she was friends with an extra who bullied me, that certain extras kept inferring I wanted an actor who was in a relationship, Casting told me she had me pulled off the show w/o an explanation  The AD told me I was still on their list.  In 01/2008 I was tripped on a set with crew from this show, spent 5 weeks in Physical therapy and I'm still working up to running short distances for safety.  <br>
<br>
I worked a show- same network- a comment appeared -never again- no explanation. In April of 2008 on a film I accosted verbally the PA. I wanted to know why I was pulled off the show just two weeks before it ended and right before Christmas. I am recalled and I show up to work to be told that Central said I canceled which their policy was 3-7 and you were out.I worked that day, &amp;  I was supposed to work for another week.<br>
<br>
I had a MASTECTOMY on sets in 2005.  I have been SAG eligible since 2004 and I am now AFTRA.  I love to laugh, but I am a professional first.  I lost my work from this company one week before they announced, though crew knew two weeks before, that the show from Dec 2007 was coming back. The entertainment industry is my past, present and future.  <br>
<br>
This company never gave me a review.  Treated my file as though it did not exist.  I was told by Casting that my file was exceptional many times and even the Vice President who did not know me told me I made a good FBI agent and I was very good at Period work.  I know there were allot more positive comments there that they treated as though they did not exist.  They took away my only source of income at a time when I was getting sick. They control 80% of the background work in Los Angeles.</p>

    <p class="description">i worked for Legal and other Temp agencies in Los Angeles.  I mostly worked for Law firms as a legal clerk, researcher, receptionist/ secretary.  I found myself often Multi-tasking.  I determined at this point that the legal profession was not my calling and I was considering what to do.  I found many of the agencies however were not willing to think outside the box for me and find me jobs that were outside law offices to use my skill set.  I had no passion for this work and also found myself being asked if I wanted to be hired beyond a temp, and turning the offers down because I really wanted to do something more creative.  It was at this point I started exploring and studying scripts and script analysis.</p>

    <p class="description">I worked for several legal temp agencies doing pre-trial evidentiary review of documents.  Most of the work involved mergers and acquisitions.   Due to the nature of the work, and for reasons of confidentiality, I am not going to list the law firms or clients.  I worked for several agencies in the Washington, DC area, in fact probably all the legal temp agencies available at the time.  Long hours and hard work.  I still have pay stubs and a record of some of this work, and probably a list of clients and firms.  Again though that information is confidential and would only be an issue for conflicts. I do not intend on returning to this work or the legal profession.  I have been employed by several of the largest firms in the US though only as a temp.</p>

    <p class="description">Did data entry and clerical work.  I spent the first few months just typing, but I remember doing something more in depth and even recall making calls to the Vice President's Office for them.  (Seriously, I remember having to call someone and being told he now works for the VP and then making the call only realize after I got off the phone that the VP was the VP.)</p>

    <p class="description">Worked for marketing and helped with Press and research.  Also assisted with grant research.  At the time the Theater was still owned by the County and they were not officially telling the public they were going private.  I waited until after they made the announcement to even tell people I did the research for them.  It was to make sure they were ready for the transition.  I felt like I was making history.  Also helped in the Box Office.  I kind of worked for every depart of the theater for free, and Operations and the Camp hired me after the internship for paid employment.</p>

      <p class="notes">I signed up for a web class a few weeks before I was diagnosed with cancer.  I wanted to find a way to work out of my home or from a lab top and use skills I knew I had and could develop.  I needed to find a second source of income and I was ready to go Union.  My objective, work for me and work in the industry on sets and around sets. There is allot of down time on sets.  I still don't have all the skills I need to do this, but events in my life have forced me to push to be on sets acting.  As someone who is Phi Betta Kappa, I will not settle for those here in Cali who infer I can't do something who have not even auditioned me or seen my grades or my work.  I find it suspect in fact that after people in the industry discovered I was not a part of a certain group and that I lost work after an accident so I could not find a lawyer to sue, I  found individuals inferring this was not going to happen now.  I will not accept criminal actions and violent actions as valid.</p>

Also, worked for the Communication Department for Free and was in charge of the equipment to make movies.  I taught myself how to use Studio 8 but never could quite master it so I taught an artist I knew how so the department would have graphic artists.  Worked for the Department of Environmental Biology for a special camp for a week to teach kids experiments.  And worked in the summer for the Department of Human Resources, where when I did not have stuff to do, I drew pictures with their computer drawing program.

      <p class="notes">I am grateful to those I met who understood that the law was probably not my true calling.  I am also grateful for the opportunity to go to San Francisco and see California and realize what I already knew- I was meant to be where I am.  I am embarrassed though by my profession.  If they are embarrassed by me and my refusal to practice, it is not laziness but a sense that I have only this life and I am tired of living it for what others want for me, when I would only want for others to be happy.  We should not be in a society where when someone is sick and broken we brush them aside and kick them when they are down.  The system creates greed and power hungry people.  I am an artist under it all and probably should have never gone to law school.  I need for you too all accept that I am not being irresponsible for not using this degree, but I am trying to do what is best for my health.  I have the right to want to not only survive, but be happy and thrive.  Cancer taught me that.</p>

			<dd>I was involved in allot here.  But I really hate the profession.  I have found that when I truly needed a lawyer, they were not there for me, or thought I was just like everyone else- after money.  If you truly have the guts to be a lawyer- do it.  I found that while I was fighting to walk no one cared as long as I could be chained to a desk.  I left the profession because I realized no one seemed to care if someone felt good or loved life.  In all the logic, being human was gone.</dd>
