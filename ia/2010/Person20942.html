    <p class="description">EVP of Operations for Operations Analysis, Inc, a wholly owned Amec company tasked with developing a web based business execution and intellectual management system based on original concepts.  Together with the EVP Business and Strategy, I was accountable for developing and executing all aspects of the business plan and vision. Principal responsibilities included product and delivery system design and web system development, strategy and partnering. I was involved in all aspects of financial and operating success including content contract negotiations and product pricing. <br>
<br>
The system provides access and support to software tools, experts, data and information for analysis and optimization. The system is focused on managing internal research and development, project delivery, customer relationships, and fostering key outside relationships. This system has the potential to dramatically increase the effectiveness of operating, service and supplier organizations.  Organizational goals included the development of web-based delivery system for tools and models to be used internally by the Amec and sold within appropriate external vertical markets. <br>
<br>
Our external partners view the system as an intellectual exchange and the means for developing a significant knowledge management system.  The system completed a successful beta involving numerous external partners between June and November 2001. OAI also offered customized dynamic simulation computer models incorporating techno-economic issues for operations &amp; enterprises.  Amec decided it was not a core business and asked us to find and external buyer/investor.<br>

The company was on track to lose in excess of $1.2 million in 1998 on revenues of approximately $5 million.  I lead the team in development of a new strategic plan as well as development of product and marketing plans.  By March 1999 it was back to break-even and on a path toward profitability for 1999.
