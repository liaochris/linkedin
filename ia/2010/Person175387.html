    <h2>Robert Wheatley&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        My role is to help clients dig deeper into their business challenges and growth opportunities. We have great appreciation not only for the power of brands and the emotional connections that can be created underneath them, but also for the seismic changes that have taken place in how consumers relate to and engage in relationships with the brands that matter to them. <br>
<br>
In some respects I'm an agent for building brand relevancy, engagement and trust. I have spent the last 30 years in the agency business, working for some of the most recognized brands, big and small, in refining their go-to-market strategies and helping them grow their business.<br>
<br>
I am reminded of David Ogilvy's famous remark about the agency he built: &quot;We sell. Or else.&quot; This mantra has followed me throughout my career. And it is at the forefront of what we do in our firm. There is a formula now that sits at the edge of success in brand building: we call it the higher purpose or strategic mission. You can read about it in more detail here: http://www.wheatleytimmons.com/pages/error_page/58.php<br>
<br>
Brands today are built on a foundation of lifestyle connection. Thus the difference from being a commodity bought on price, vs one that is sought after and enjoyed by its user -- this has much to do with the ability of businesses to align themselves and help enable the passions, interests and desires of those they wish to sell to.<br>
<br>
Call it &quot;permission&quot; based brand relationships grounded in relevancy. Purchase decisions spring from emotional judgments. We know the keys to unlocking those connections.<br>
<br>
This means consumer insight research is vital to designing communications and public relations strategies that work.<br>
<br>
Clients get more from us than great creative and ideas. They also find a resource in helping them map and plan their brand strategy, new product and channel decisions, too. In short, we help sell. Or else.

    <p class="description">We are all about successful brand building.

  </p>
    <p class="description">Focused on food, beverage, household and health/beauty aids brands. We started the business in 1990 with Sara Lee as our founding client at a time when the venerable brand was in need of triage. Our revival campaign centered around the &quot;First International Symposia on Dessert&quot; staged in Vienna, Austria (dessert capitol of the world) in front of the top food journalists from the US and Canada. It was a spectacular success. In combination with other programs focused on high brand development indexed markets, the business results turned around in 9 months time.<br>
<br>
We also represented First Alert home safety products. And in collaboration with then client, Rich Timmons (yes, the same person), we launched the first residential carbon monoxide alarm product category via the &quot;Silent Killer&quot; public education campaign. A huge success by any definition: $100 million in sales within 15 months of launch on the back of a comprehensive PR campaign. <br>
<br>
We also represented Labatt USA's portfolio of beers, Hoover vacuum products, Bosch appliances, Progresso soups, H20 skin care products, Kaukauna Cheese, projects for Sears, Starbucks and others.<br>
<br>
My role centered in strategic planning and creative campaign development. It was my first foray into owning an agency. I learned a lot --- starting from scratch with no safety net except wits and determination, we built a successful agency by doing great work that consistently delivered sales and market share growth.</p>

Terrific success helping integrate tactics across PR, ad and promotion platforms. Highlight was our re-launch of their home electronics store-within-a-store concept: Brand Central. Same day store sales performance broke all targets consistently through the introduction period.<br>
<br>
Agency was acquired by WPP group seven months after I arrived in Chicago. Big changes. A lot of us who were veterans thought long and hard. In my case it was time to do something new, so I left to start my own firm.</p>

    <p class="description">O&amp;M/West (based in LA) included all of Ogilvy's PR operations and businesses on the west coast, including offices in LA, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. I was responsible for integrating the former offices of Cole &amp; Weber PR (Seattle, Portland, San Francisco) with Ogilvy's LA business into a new group. <br>
<br>
O&amp;M's LA business at the time of the integration was in turmoil. We brought new strategic focus to the staff and clients, completed acquisitions to add new capability (public affairs), revenue and talent to the business. <br>
<br>
Strategically was hands-on with the largest LA-based accounts including Carnation (now Nestle) and Hunt-Wesson (now Con Agra). Created the Search for the Friskiest Cat in America campaign for Friskies brand -- credited with lifting that brand t the number one share position for the first time in 20 years on the shelf. <br>
<br>
Assisted other offices in business development and strategic campaign development.<br>
<br>
By this time my reputation in the O&amp;M world was burnished as a champion of integrated communications thinking, with special expertise in consumer brand marketing.</p>

    <p class="description">Cole &amp; Weber, headquartered in Seattle, is a wholly-owned but autonomous subsidiary of Ogilvy &amp; Mather. An unusual company in its day as a combination of three distinct businesses: an advertising agency, dominant in the Pacific Northwest by a very wide margin; a PR firm that grew to become the largest in the region; and a market research operation.<br>
<br>
I ran the PR company. I built an office network that included businesses in Seattle, Portland and San Francisco. I had over-sight of PR operations also in Calgary and Edmonton, Canada. My vision was a West Coast powerhouse. This plan eventually led to a merger with the parent company's PR division and creation of O&amp;M/West.<br>
<br>
Our largest client was Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts, based in Seattle. I was immersed in that business on a number of levels. As well as Weyerhaeuser Company, Washington Apple Commission, Chateau Ste. Michelle wines, GNA Financial products, Roman Meal bread, Nalley's Foods and others.<br>
<br>
I was an early believer in integrated communications plans and worked hard to bring PR thinking to the strategic table at the CMO level with client organizations. I had ideas that would cross platforms and routinely found myself in planning meetings that bridged various disciplines of communication.</p>

    <p class="description">Through an unusual set of circumstances that unfolded as I planned to move on from Cole &amp; Weber to Chiat Day, I was given the keys to the PR firm and put in charge of it. I was 29 years old. Trial by fire. Determined to make it go, and it did. <br>
<br>
Brought in my partner, Jim McFarland, who to this day is one of the most dynamic, wonderful, talented people I know in the business. the two of us were formidable. <br>
<br>
We began expansion into new markets after righting the P&amp;L and returning the business to growth mode.</p>
