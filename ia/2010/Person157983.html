    <h2>Owen Richard Kindig&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        Chip and Dan Heath, authors of &quot;Made to Stick&quot;, make &quot;Story&quot; one of the six essential ingredients of an idea that gains traction in the marketplace of ideas. I would submit that &quot;Story&quot; is the only essential quality for stickiness... because well-told stories embody the other 5 ingredients.<br>
<br>
Stories are simple -- they are easy to understand and relate to.<br>
Stories are unexpected -- they have a plot with twists and turns, surprises, challenges, luck, and disappointment, that is always stranger than fiction and much, much, more interesting.<br>
Stories are concrete -- they involve the clash of ideas, facts -- reality. They often explore the imaginary but they are always grounded in the human condition.<br>
Stories are credible -- we believe their reality and pathos. <br>
Stories are emotional, and ultimately stories inspire us because they are the warp and woof of our conscious human existence.<br>
<br>
We are artists who tell, not OUR story or OUR TAKE on your story, but YOUR story. We can broadcast your story dramatically, with full cinematic sweep, or we can whisper it in words, pictures, or graffiti-style video where it might gain a hearing for just the right audience.<br>
<br>
Our logo is taken directly from ancient cave art, and illustrates that we are in the business of helping clients reach their audiences through the power of their stories. We put your stories on the cave wall.<br>
<br>
We can help colleges reach the &quot;right&quot; students with authenticity, or help them communicate fundraising messages to potential donors. We can also deliver an amazing GPS-guided admissions tour experience for colleges. <br>
<br>
We can help humanitarian institutions find and tell their stories.We've helped our clients raise millions of dollars with elegance and integrity.<br>
<br>
For corporate clients, Ztoryteller LLC knows how to sell, how to impress, how to explain, and how to motivate. You can count on us for panache, for creative distinction, and for trend-setting quality with hard-hitting results.

    <p class="description">My Ohio corporate name has been Still Images, Inc. since September 1990 and for most of the last 10 years I've been &quot;doing business as&quot; Kindig Omnimedia. In June of last year I began to change the name of my company to Ztories (pronounced &quot;Stories&quot;) Integrated Marketing Communications. In December 2009 I moved to Seattle and closed my Ohio corporation.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">At Kindig Omnimedia the emphasis was marketing for all kinds of companies and organizations, via all kinds of media. Primarily, we did corporate and institutional video but also designed web sites, advertising, photography, etc. Clients included Nestle Ice Cream and Norse Dairy Systems (consumer foods and packaging/processing), Glencoe McGraw-Hill (publishing), URS Corp. (architecture/engineering), and many others.<br>
<br>
I changed the name of the company in 2007 to reflect a narrower focus: recruiting and fundraising efforts for educational/humanitarian clients. The new name is Ztories IMC (Integrated Marketing Communications) and the focus is on story-telling. See my description under the Ztories name.</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">After leaving Harlan, I started Graphic Spectrum with the goal of providing graphic services to ad agencies ... high quality short run offset printing, advertising art (in those days we called it pasteup). Within a year I rediscovered the exciting world of 35mm photography and multi-image -- cinematic presentations using up to 12 slide projectors. <br>
<br>
I was blessed with a gift for writing and photography, and my company quickly grew through the awards we won for clients like Conrad, Phillips and Vutech, Denison University, The Columbus Dispatch, Owens Illinois (Toledo), Digital Equipment Corporation (Boston, New York offices), Ohio University, Cedarville University, Ohio Wesleyan University, Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, and my favorite, The Drumstick Company which became Nestle Ice Cream. <br>
<br>
The ultimate failure of Graphic Spectrum, Inc. taught me a lot of lessons that I'll be happy to share over lunch!</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">I worked as the production manager of Harlan Typographic in Columbus during the period of its explosive growth. We went from 3 employees to 13 employees in that year. We served advertising agencies exclusively -- setting type 24/7. My job was to do the markup, customer service, and supervision. I ended up working 16 hours most days.<br>
<br>
I also was responsible for hiring and training all the typesetters, and maintaining the equipment (I had taken electronic repair courses from Mergenthaler Linotype and had learned how to adjust and replace components by using an oscilloscope.)<br>
<br>
The best part about that job was that when I decided to leave and start my own service company to ad agencies, I only needed to make 12 sales calls and I had already achieved credibility with the best ad agencies in Central Ohio including Byer &amp; Bowman, Swink, Hameroff/Milenthal, GSW, etc. (names that are now long gone!)</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">I started as an apprentice typographer at Kreber, and learned a lot about the printing and advertising world. <br>
<br>
Photo-typesetting was just starting ... I learned on paper-tape keyboards and the Mergenthaler VIP machine. Before long I was fixing it when it broke (a weekly event). We also pioneered in  OCR when it first came out, using IBM Selectrics for data input. Eventually I became the type dept. manager, for clients like Gold Circle Stores, Packaging Corp. of America, Cardinal Industries, and Treasure Chest printing.<br>
<br>
I left for Harlan because I was eager to specialize in the high quality, high energy world of advertising. But I have remained close to the Kreber family and several times over the last decade I have helped them with my video, writing, and creative direction skills. <br>
<br>
The best thing I ever did for Kreber was introduce them to my brother-in-law, Todd Alexander, who still works there and is truly one of their rain-makers, their VP National Accounts.</p>

I passed the recession test in 2000; and the Eldercare test as my dad's caretaker from his stroke in 2000 till his death in 2002. <br>
<br>
The business has had to evolve from staff-based to free agent-based delivery of creative talent; but I now have the best team in the business.  And my own personal skillset in all the communications disciplines continues to improve. I'll never graduate, but I feel like I'm keeping up with the coursework and abreast of the best in the class.<br>
<br>
Thanks for trusting me to learn about your business, and for giving me the opportunity to pass the test of improving your enterprise!</p>

      <p class="notes">The year Graphic Spectrum peaked turned into the year it hit the wall. While I focused on over-producing the creative product for clients like Digital, Denison U, McGraw-Hill, and Owens-Illinois, my management team taught me a bitter lesson in what &quot;the buck stops here&quot; really means. Thanks to Sandy Wood, John Fippin, Will Logan, and others for trusting me to start over and pay them back (eventually). I sold my best assets to the wrong folks, but I never sold my soul. In the end, it was a good experience that left me a lot wiser and a little smarter.</p>

      <p class="notes">When video arrived, it wasn't long before our clients asked us to join the revolution. At first, it wasn't fun... going from the pristine quality of 35mm slides to dark, grainy video. I loved multi-image, but video was an acquired taste that took me a long time to develop. But by the end of this course of study I was hired by Digital Equipment Corporation to tell their salespeople how to brace for a future in which hardware sales would no longer sustain their company, and software services would be king. I learned the craft of cinematic production from the ground up... and discovered the power of moving images to move audiences in ways multi-image never could. And I learned that interviewing people... discovering their stories ... is my greatest professional joy and my greatest gift.</p>

      <p class="notes">One day Jim Vutech called and asked if I could do a slide show. &quot;Sure!&quot; Actually, I'd already produced a 9-projector show about the Great Pyramid with my friends, and it was traveling around the country. But I'd never done one commercially. Vutech's Big Brothers/Big Sisters show was a hit, and soon my time was filled with projects for Denison University, Ohio Wesleyan, Owens-Illinois, and the Drumstick Company. The most pivotal event was another Vutech project that won a &quot;Best of Show&quot; at the Addy's. The editor of Millimeter Magazine, who was a judge along with two senior creatives from Gray Advertising, said to me, &quot;Dick, this stuff is equal to the highest New York standards!&quot; We went on to win 27 Addys over the next few years. The most important thing I learned? Confidence.</p>

      <p class="notes">When I saw the handwriting on the wall for typesetting, I started printing high quality, short run work in my garage and called on my ad agency clients: Conrad Phillips Vutech, Hameroff, Swink, Clay, Richardson/Smith, etc. Soon I also added 35mm slides to the offerings, and I was off to the races. The most fun was inventing my own animation cameras... and then building the business to where we had a staff of 15 and could buy a Marron Carrell computerized animation camera. But in 1983, we were still working in my 2-story garage with maybe 4 employees.</p>

      <p class="notes">While at Kreber Graphics I learned the art of typography. Rick Lloyd, my mentor and friend, taught me to set type character by character using a Photo-Typositor. The Mergenthaler VIP arrived the week I started, and I learned to love typography as I set and marked up type for labels, ads, and books. When the equipment broke down, I learned to repair it myself. Kreber bought me an oscilloscope and I actually attended the Mergenthaler electronics school in upstate New York.</p>
