    <h2>John Exley&#8217;s Summary</h2>
    
      <p class="summary">
        I love God, my family, &amp; my friends more than anything in the world. In three words, I am: loyal, compassionate, and dedicated. I think my background is somewhat unique: I was homeschooled by my mom until the 10th grade, am a born-again Christian, and grew up in a small town but spent much of my teenage years playing basketball in Rochester's inner city. I love building relationships and learning!<br>
DETAILS: <br>
I was born in Rochester, New York and lived on 32 Dayton Street for the first few years of my life. I was raised in Bristol, NY (40 minutes south of Rochester) for the rest of my upbringing. I am grateful to have an amazing extended family of relatives and friends! I am a junior Interdisciplinary Engineering &amp; Management major at Clarkson University in northern NY. I just finished studying abroad at the National University of Singapore; this fall I will be studying at American University as part of the Washington Semester.<br>
GOALS: <br>
I am very passionate about entrepreneurship and I aspire to build a business before I am 30 years old that creates value and is sustainable while providing an avenue whereby I might help the friends and family I care so deeply for. Since I was little, it has been a dream of mine to attend law school - so I may pursue a JD+MBA one day as well. <br>
PERSONALITY: <br>
I love connecting with people and having unforgettable experiences with the people I love! God is my foundation, relationships are the center of my happiness, coffee can be my fuel, technology is my muse, traveling = source of discovery, fashion is my self-expression, and helping others is my cup of tea.

    <p class="description">- As President, an immediate challenge I faced was the resignation of our faculty advisor &amp; the highly emotional divisions internally between the club members &amp; externally with Clarkson's School of Business (CUSB). I helped broker an agreement with the CUSB Dean in which our economics prof. &amp; the Deputy Director of Clarkson's Shipley Center for Innovation assumed &#x2018;co-advisor&#x2019; roles. <br>
- - Meanwhile, I worked super hard to drive the club out of its disarray &amp; unite the members. Working closely with our COO, I helped write &amp; implement a constitution. We launched a website, encouraged members to create new committees (I helped one freshman start &#x201c;CEO Consultants&#x201d; &amp; create a fundraising team with the Engineers Without Borders club as its 1st project), &amp; implemented a plan for &#x2018;absolute transparency&#x2019; within our Executive Board. Transparency was crucial for us to reestablish trust with the entire organization. I created detailed agendas for every meeting &amp; we shared them with the whole club. To provide better decision making, I co-founded the &quot;Business Analysis Team&quot; (see below).<br>
- - - My goal was to develop CEO into a vehicle for spreading entrepreneurship across campus &amp; unifying students from different majors together. Along with CEO Consultants partnering on fundraising projects with other organizations, I also thought this goal could be realized via CEO becoming a sort of incubator/birthplace for other student run clubs. To encourage learning, I organized Clarkson's 1st Elevator Pitch competition (detailed below). <br>
- - - - Before becoming President, I volunteered 30+ hours for our Breast Cancer Awareness Month initiative, helping to raise &amp; donate nearly $7,000 while contributing to our club winning &quot;Best Fundraising Idea&quot; at the National CEO Conference in Chicago.<br>
- - - - - Finally, while attending my last National CEO Conference as President in October 2009, I was able to speak on several panels about how we successfully grew &amp; recharged the culture of our club.</p>

    <p class="description">- While still President of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization (CEO), I organized a conference with angel investor and serial entrepreneur Jerry Hacker at his personal estate. 12 student members of CEO met with Mr. Hacker, several investors, &amp; inventor/Clarkson professor Ken Visser to discuss multiple business opportunities. <br>
- - From this gathering, I founded Sustainable Synergy: a student-run organization that seeks to improve the energy usage of Clarkson by helping implement alternative and renewable energy solutions. During the summer of 2009, I assembled a leadership team of diversely-talented students &amp; created an organizational structure for the club. It was a unique experience where I tried to lead the club in committing itself to a clear vision for existence, establishing a foundation for succession, and in creating a plan to gain momentum at the start of the fall semester. <br>
- - - Today, the club has sustained its rapid growth, succeeding in its first project of installing solar panels on Cheel Arena.</p>

    <p class="description">- As an intern, I was the process owner of the Defective Material Return (DMR) process for all purchased parts in GE's Grove City (Pennsylvania) Engine Plant. The plant purchases $450M of material per year.  At any given time, it holds over $600k of defective materials in process. I was responsible for ensuring that all supplier related DMR&#x2019;s were processed in a timely manner. <br>
- - I worked cross-functionally with the Materials Team, Engineering, Quality, Production, and externally with Suppliers to ensure defects were processed and transacted correctly. I submitted a business proposal to redesign the process and implement improvements utilizing Lean concepts (proposal was not implemented). I also created $250k worth of shipping notices that removed almost 50% of defective materials from inventory. <br>
- - - At the conclusion of my internship, I won the &quot;Most Likely to be Next CEO&quot; award at the GE Transportation Intern's Banquet.</p>

    <p class="description">- I served as the primary assistant to the President and CEO (Kent Heyman) of the world's leading provider of Synchronization and Migration Software in the midst of launching its &#x201c;first version&#x201d; software product (see Syncables: http://www.syncables.com/). I created a PowerPoint presentation to be used in potential M&amp;A&#x2019;s and client interactions while also writing a company story detailing the compelling transition the startup made following its infancy. <br>
- - I also published an article on Unpaid Internships and how I secured this (although brief) thrilling position; explaining how I worked without compensation because of my passion for the technology field and my desire to gain direct knowledge from a successful leader (07.07.09, Unpaid Internships: A Secret to Success for Gen Y http://under30ceo.com/2009/07/07/unpaid-internships-secret-to-success-for-gen-y/).</p>

    <p class="description">- While President of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization (CEO), I co-founded BAT as a subcommittee of CEO to perform in-depth evaluations of current and potential business endeavors for the club. We implemented a Point Of Sale information system to the club's student run business, the Kiosk, that made inventory management more efficient and enabled effective financial reporting. I established a partnership with local start-up North Country Farms, developing marketing strategies to sell their wheat pancake mix that enabled us to raise approximately $385.<br>
- - Also, I organized the Elevator Pitch Competition and raised $3,500 to bring in the distinguished author of &quot;The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur&quot; &amp; CEO of Obsidian Launch, Mike Michalowicz, as keynote speaker and judge. Thanks to the close mentorship of Daniel Xavier, I learned a lesson in the value of extending ownership of the event to the BAT team members (it was at this point that the team became fully engaged and our preparation really took off). We welcomed the campus and community to attend and celebrate entrepreneurship. Matt Wilson (Co-Founder of Under30CEO &amp; former president of Bryant University's CEO chapter) also gave a speech and judged the competition. The other judges included  the Dean of Clarkson's School of Business, Tim Sugrue; Mrs. Karen Collins (the wife of Clarkson University's President Tony Collins), and Scott Bradley (the PR/Marketing Director for Obsidian Launch at the time).</p>

  </p>
    <p class="description">- While I first started working for the landscaping startup PropertyCare, Inc. in my teenage years (responsible for line trimming and mulching), during the summer of 2008 I moved indoors as an intern. <br>
- - I assisted the COO, Jeff Brown, in the implementation of a Microsoft Dynamics CRM computer software system to manage sales all the way down to operations, making end-to-end business more efficient. I helped train the sales manager and two salesmen in CRM, utilizing its capabilities to (among other things) shorten the lead time for quote generation and improve customer service. <br>
- - - Also, I wrote a partial business plan for the company to focus its growth efforts in one direction. PropertyCare had the goal of gaining external funding to help achieve their vision of expanding to other markets in upstate New York. My research was primarily with the Syracuse area and whether its market could support the costs of opening a new branch of operations. Ultimately, the company changed course (halting its plans for expansion) and before I finished creating the business plan, shifted my efforts to the CRM implementation project exclusively.</p>
