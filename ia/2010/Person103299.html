    <p class="description">Primary responsibility was to develop results-oriented segmentation-based marketing programs for the Protection Agreement business, with emphasis on the aftermarket programs.  This culminated in communicating to the customer at the right time with the right offer via the right channel and in the right way.  Specifically, I was charged with leading our efforts to refine our customer segmentation strategy and use it to drive our customer experience, product and promotion, and fulfillment strategies.   Concentrating first on the customer experience, I led the charge to restructure and retrain our telemarketing units to customize the selling experience based on what we know about the customers through segmentation.  Secondarily I had responsibility for assisting in test evaluation, contact strategy, and list selection.  I participated in evaluation of response models and in contact depth decisions.<br>
<br>
As manager in this group, I was required to establish and work in concert with cross-functional teams including product development, underwriting, analytics and representatives from the many direct marketing channels: telemarketing, direct mail, technicians and online.  I established a vision and strategy for leveraging the Internet and electronic communication to better reach our customers, reduce costs, and create incremental revenue streams.  I introduced and sold this strategy to Sr. Management, recruited and established a cross-functional team, and implemented many of the initiatives laid out.  Additionally, I developed and implemented an &quot;Add-an-Item&quot; program to move 1-item customers to multiple items.  This program was based on coverage affinity and tested in both telemarketing and direct mail.</p>
